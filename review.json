The proximity of his apartment to the airport, and the air conditioning are big pluses in our book. Also, having traveled elsewhere around Spain, having an elevator is also a big plus. The rate was extremely affordable, and Arturo definitely deserves the five star rating on this site. \r\n\r\nTwo things to keep in mind when booking. First, while the Madrid metro is extremely convenient, Arturo's apartment isn't close to downtown Madrid. This may not matter to you, but as young-ish first time travelers to Madrid, we had some late nights coming back to the apartment. Despite that, I thought that being close to the airport was a nice compromise.\r\n\r\nAlso, there isn't a lock on the door.

There is a station change, but the metro is easily naviagable and the ones you will be using are accessible. Traveling with rolling luggage won't be a problem.  There are elevators and escalators. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is safe, the neighbors are all friendly. \r\n\r\nThe apartment building has a doorman, who welcomed me with the keys,  & personally escorted me to the elevator. Upon entering the view of the outdoor pool is breathtaking. It almost feels like a european Melrose Place, but without drama, lol.\r\n\r\nOpening the door to the apartment, I drew in a breath while squealing with delight.  I was struck by how spotless it is! The wooden floors are gorgeous, the light filters in. I simply picked up my luggage to bring into the room I was staying in, and for additional care, I placed it directly on the little area rug by the night stand. \r\n\r\nThe bathroom was so clean you could eat off the toilet, lol, but no, I did not actually do so. I loved the wall tiles in calming blues and the water pressure in the shower. A hand towel and bath towel were thoughtfully left for me on the bed. \r\n\r\nAgustina is a lovely woman, who not only made me feel like a treasured guest, but also spent time comforting me when I'd gotten flustered after a night of wondering lost after boarding a random bus in a freak windstorm. Her kindness was so appreciated. She was patient with my spanglish, encouraging when I'd felt deflated, and generous with her suggestions of an itinerary. \r\n\r\nI apologize for the delay in posting this review approximately a month after my return to the states, but I couldn't in good conscience neglect to share my wonderful experience. My memories of Madrid are so special to me. This was my first trip abroad as a single woman from start to finish, and I could not have asked for a better experience. Thank you so much, Agustina.

After both myself and AirBnB contacted her several times without response, I decided to leave  her place in order to get a better night's sleep.

Clean and the host was incredibly friendly, accomodating and a pleasure to meet, rent from.   A few things to note... during my stay the room required A/C due to the heat and required that a unit be set up in balcony entrance which meant that the doors had to remain open to the street.  This meant that I couldn't shut the street noise out to sleep and also that the apartment could not be locked if I wanted A/C.  I came in around 4pm to take a nap one of the days I was there and woke up to a construction man right at my balcony doors because there is also scaffolding on the building and construction happening.   This also meant that the apartment is technically accessible from the street whenever those balcony doors are open.  If you are single female traveler like myself, or have items that need to be secured I wouldn't recommend this spot.  I'm not sure what conditions are like in the winter (heating).

The apartment is so conveniently located that I was able to walk everywhere, and because it is minutes away from the Sol, I got an intimate first look of the lively night life in Madrid. The city has an amazing public transportation system which is very well marked and navigating through the metro system turned out to be much easier than I thought. There is also the fantastic rail system. I was able to take day trips to Segovia and Toledo via the high speed train for very reasonable prices. I  thoroughly enjoyed myself, and would definitely return in the future. ","listing_name":"Great Vacational Apartments","price_for_night":65.0},
{"review_id":2741100,"score":48,"comments":"Overall, our stay was incredible.  We greatly enjoyed the apartment, found the location quite convenient, and appreciated Dana's kindness.  We stayed for three nights (Wed-Sat) and enjoyed a nice home-made breakfast each morning (a grocery store is quite close) replete with fresh coffee.  We also cooked dinner one night and found that the apartment was adequately stocked for a simple dinner.\r\n\r\nThat said, there are a couple things that I think potential guests should know:\r\n\r\n1) the apartment is not lived in by a permanent resident.  Rather, it is treated as an investment and seems to be rented, along with many other similar apartments, through Airbnb.  This means that you do not have to worry about clutter of another person's belongings, but it also means that the apartment lacks certain items you would expect in someone's apartment: salt, pepper, paper towels, etc.  \r\n\r\n2) while the apartment was quite quiet on Wednesday night, it was quite loud on Thursday and Friday nights.  I currently live in the Village in New York City and am used to loud street traffic, but this was unbelievably loud and continued past 6 am.  I would stay again during the week, but given the noise, I would definitely think twice before staying over the weekend.\r\n\r\n3) because it appears that this ad represents several units in the same building, the specific layout of your unit may vary, and I would not rely on the photos to ensure the precise layout.  The apartment I stayed in had the bedroom in the back which helped with noise, but I do not know if other apartments are configured differently.  This fact also appears to explain how there are 40+ reviews.\r\n\r\nThat all said, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend the apartment to others.","listing_name":"Great Vacational Apartments","price_for_night":65.0},

La localizacion inmejorable ya que tienes todo cerca y al ser un piso interior no se oye el ruido de la calle. El tamaÃ±o perfecto para una pareja. Tiene todo lo necesario para poder preparar algo en casa y no tener que estar siempre comiendo fuera.\r\nSofia, la anfitriona se mostro muy atenta siempre a pesar de no poder estar para recibirnos estuvo siempre pendiente y no hubo problemas para comunicarnos con ella.\r\n\r\nAspectos negativos:  mas que aspecto negativo..diria cosas a mejorar/o cambiar.  Nos dio la sensacion de que Sofia, muy amable por su parte, queria ser flexible con la salida y entrada de los inquilinos y nos parecio un poco incomodo que los siguientes nos llamasen a la puerta para salir antes de la hora acordada y se quedasen esperando al lado de la puerta.  Creo que si hay check in/check out el mismo dia, se deberia de poner unas horas fijas de entrada y salida para evitar situaciones incomodas.

It was nice to shop at the excellent market nearby, and eat breakfast at the apartment before starting out for the day. The apartment is well located near 2 metro stops, but we walked everywhere. The apartment is in Salamanca, a safe upscale neighborhood with top designer stores, if you're into that. There are also small grocery stores, patisseries, restaurants and lots of local character.

He cancelled our reservation a few weeks before our arrival - with no explanation. To make up for it, he offered us his own apartment in the same building but on the fourth floor. It is a gorgeous place and recently renovated. He has very good taste. Overall we liked it very much, but were disappointed by the original cancellation because we had to give up the extra bedroom. That meant telling our friends who were going to spend a weekend with us that there was no room for them. We also missed a few of the amenities described such as a DVD player, toaster oven, coffee machine, and the American phone number. He told us that the bed was a queen, but it was definitely a full. We had a Spanish friend look at it, and also said it was smaller than a queen. The windows are well insulated but there is still some noise from the interior patios. This is apartment living so be forewarned that it is not always quiet, especially on the weekends and if you want to open the windows. The building's doorman is very friendly. We felt very safe in the building and neighborhood. It has excellent public transportation nearby. In addition to the metro, I highly recommend the bus, especially to go to Atocha (number 26).

Walking distance to Plaza Espana, Calle Princesa and Gran Via, which means relatively quick access to restaurants, supermarkets, Royal Palace, ATMs, and Plaza Espana metro station. We had purchased a few bus tours on Viator, which were served by Julia Travel, and the departure point was at Plaza Espana.\r\n\r\nKitchen is cozy, everything is provided - fridge, microwave, toaster, tea kettles. Plenty of hot water and good water pressure. Couple of drawbacks that come to mind is summer heat - Madrid can be quite hot and dusty, in an apartment without air conditioner that means open door to the balcony during the night. Which leads to another drawback - there's a fairly popular restaurant two floors down below, with Spanish tradition of late night dining that means loud songs and other noise till late at night. However, overall the experience was pretty tolerable.\r\n\r\nThere's a fairly large daily market (Mercado) at Calle de Reyers a block away from the apartment, it's a windowless building that's easy to miss.

Being so near la gran via makes life easy in Madrid. Great nightlife and food everywhere. Walking distance to the royal palace and parque del sol. Plaza mayor is about a 10 minute walk from the apartment. El retiro park is a 10 minute metro ride (about 5 stops) and the metro is a 30 second walk from the apartment ( plaza de santo Domingo). The apartment has 2 single beds (a little rough for us being a young couple) and a couple couches that turn into beds. A great place to stay if you plan on mostly just leaving your stuff in the apartment and getting lost in Madrid for your stay. Raquel was nice enough to have a converter for some of your electronics, a coffee maker, iron, clean towels, and a washing machine (no dryer, not a thing in a Spain I guess. Air dry) the shower does get a little cold as it is in not in its own enclosed bathroom but basically part of the bedroom. Not a lot of hot water (10 minute shower at most) which is rough because the first thing I wanted after 18 hours in planes was a long, hot shower. The wifi was pretty spotty (it works best in the living room, not in the bathroom, and very slow in the bedroom). In summary I would stay here again no question. The location was just too perfect and central. Raquel was very easy to communicate with also, even with our late check in after midnight.

The apartment was as shown in the picture and was located on 3rd floor (There was an elevator to use). Check-in was smooth and Raquel was there to receive us on time. Apartment was clean and had all the amenities promised (like utensils/cutlery, microwave oven, fridge, electric hob, washing machine, hair dryer, cloth hangers, AC/heaters, toiletries like napkins / towels and bed linens. Oh even an umbrella).\n\nThe location was great and had 5 metro stations (Plaza de Espana, Santo Domingo, Callao, Opera and Sol) and 1 bus terminus (Callao) in the close proximity.  There were numerous supermarkets in the vicinity. Yet the house was calm and quite (may be because it was not facing the street).\n\nPros:\n1. Apartment is as showcased by host.\n2. Good amenities provided\n3. 2 bedrooms (though small in size, they are decent enough)\n4. Great location and ease of connectivity by metro/bus\n5. Great hospitality by host\n\nCons (but not deal breakers):\n1. Internet speed might be bit disappointing sometimes as the router is in the other unit of the apartment (but host confirmed to address this immediately after I vacated).\n2. Small kitchen sink that might be annoying for a regular user.\n3. Toilet and bathrooms do not have doors. The doors of bedroom are of plain glass.

The apartment is fairly basic but for the price and location, you cannot get much better. My only complaint is sometimes the electric would go out if you have a lot of items on at once.

Das Bett bzw. die Schlafcouch ist sehr bequem, jedoch fÃ¼r meinen 1,92m groÃen Freund ein kleines bisschen zu kurz gewesen.

{"review_id":904642,"score":60,"comments":"Mercedes is a lovely person and a delightful hostess, so I want to be able to give her apartment a fantastic review. The apartment is teeny tiny, newly remodeled, dark, and a good choice for someone who is not claustrophobic.  Those descriptions may sound contradictory but a careful review reader who parses each word will be fully informed and better able to determine if this is the place for him/her. The apartment is actually a single room on the interior air shaft of a beautiful old Madrid apartment that Mercedes occupies.  While visitors have a separate door and key, you do enter her apartment to get to your room.  Once you have seen Mercedes' gorgeous sun and light-filled rooms on the other side of the entry hall, your room feels even more cell-like.  One mandatory for me is wireless Internet access and that was a problem during my visit.  Mercedes was apologetic and tried to help but her network remained a problem throughout my stay.  In order to check the day's weather, without internet, you have to lean way into your air shaft window and try to see the sky---difficult.  There is also an odd smell, like sewage mixed with curry, that bubbles up from the shower drain and permeates the space.  The one window does not bring any light into the space but opening it did provide some relief from the smell, even if it also brought cold in. On the plus side, the remodel is new, the bed is comfortable, the kitchen is easy to use and stocked with Ikea basics, there is a generous wardrobe for clothes, and the towel warmer in the doll-like bathroom keeps the whole apartment warm and dries socks and delicates (and warms towels for shower--also provided).  The bery best part about the apartment is Mercedes, her kindness, and her wonderful suggestions for seeing Madrid.  ","listing_name":"Retiro Park, Stay at cosy studio","price_for_night":63.0},

With the hit and miss nature of hotel experiences threatening the enjoyment of our vacation, we decided to forgo the risk and stay with Mercedes.\r\n\r\nThe other reviews are correct: the space is cozy, so don't expect a palace (though we did note that it feels bigger than the pictures indicate). However the apartment is impeccably clean, charming, convenient to subways, and located in a safe and quiet part of the city away from the annoying tourist-y areas (for those familiar with New York City, think an Upper West Side-ish vibe). The well-equipped kitchenette was also ideal for our style of vacation -- we made light breakfast in every morning, and kept snacks for the afternoons and evenings, too.\r\n\r\nMercedes' home is in an elegant elevator building with secure access and a very up-scale feel. Returning to the apartment at the end of the day really felt like coming home rather than checking back in to a nondescript hotel room. The host herself is gracious and sweet, as well.\r\n\r\nWe would recommend Mercedes' apartment to friends, family and anyone else visiting Madrid.

{"review_id":13931256,"score":98,"comments":"Felipe was very responsive to our emails and flexible. He let us drop off our luggage early so we wouldn't have to carry it around with us. He was also understanding about the fact that there would be a third person staying with us for just part of the week; he only applied the extra person charge for those nights. His apartment is small, but in our experience that is normal for Madrid. It is clean and stocked with everything necessary--extra sheets, towels, cooking utensils, etc. The internet connection is good, which we appreciated very much. The best thing is the apartment's location--it is easy to get to the airport by Metro (which we did on the way in) or by Cercanias at Atocha (which we did on the way out). We didn't find it necessary to use the Metro while we were staying at Felipe's apartment--we like to walk and all the places we wanted or needed to go to (museums, Retiro, other major sights, buses leaving from Principe Pio) were within a 30-minute walk. But it is very close to three Metro stations if you prefer not to walk. The apartment opens onto a courtyard shared with the rest of the building. During the day you can hear other people talking or watching TV if you have the window open, but for the most part the neighbors are quiet at night and we had no trouble sleeping. In any case, the windows could be closed and the AC turned on to drown out any outside noise. The shower is small. We are thin but very tall and found it a bit cramped. I mention this not because it was a problem for us but because some larger people might find it hard to use the shower. All things considered, we can confidently recommend Felipe's apartment--he's a good host and his apartment worked very well for us. \r\nIf you stay here we highly recommend eating dinner at the nearby Gau&Cafe--it's on a rooftop just a few blocks away.

The flat is very tastefully presented, spacious, bright and the location is very central.  However, to justify the high cost that we paid, (same as any three-star hotel in the area), there are some important improvements I recommend, (and am confident Vin would accommodate). 1. Much greater cleanliness is required, this was in our mind not acceptable and easily solved. 2. A proper 3rd bed or mattress, my friend slept horribly on the one present. 3. Communicating the heavy slog up and down the 4 floors without an elevator, my friend has back issues and caused us some grief. And 4th, I seriously think it's poor form to charge us for towels and linen and late arrival when we are already paying for one of the most expensive flats in the area.

Close to some amazing restaurants  and the Museo Reina Sofia. A 10-15 minute walk to Chueca and various parks and museums.  Great for a couple or a family with one or two kids.  Vin was a great communicator and greeted us upon arrival.  A great value for the space overall.  Would stay there again, but with a smaller group or with my partner.  Everything we needed to make meals.  A grocery store is nearby and a market which made things easy.\n\nCONS: Just a few little things: a tight space for 5 adult friends alnd only one bathroom, but we made it work since we are like family.  Lots of stairs for people that have mobility challenges. Clean, but not polished. Consider bringing your own pillows if you're picky.  Needs new blinds on the skylights - very bright in the morning if you're a late sleeper and if you have someone in your group sleeping in the loft space.  Perhaps an umbrella on the balcony or fix the awning for additional shade.\n\nOVERALL: Would DEFINITELY recommend this place to young, unpicky people (e.g. the bomhemian backpacker or hipster couple who likes to have fun in a cool space.)

It's also a small and quiet street with little traffic, but very close to many popular tabernas and pubs (one is just down the street). \r\n\r\nSecond - the flat is exactly like on the pictures, quite modern and very smart from the convenience point of view. Also very comfortable, we felt like at home and never had any problems with anything.\r\n\r\nAlicia and Carlos are great hosts, very nice, very caring, always helpful and, in our case, very flexible with both very late arrival and late checkout.

Day of, we found the apartment with no problems- he had given us fabulous directions. He helped us up to his flat (we were in the process of moving to London, so we were carrying a TON of luggage), and then offered us a beer while he explained the lay of the land.  He gave us a brief orientation not only to the flat, but to Madrid itself- providing us with maps of the neighbourhood, the city and the metro system.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is a great spot- big and bright, and the bedroom is very comfortable.  He has a whole shelf of maps, travel books, etc. to make the orientation even easier.  Raul made us breakfast every morning, and we had a key to come and go as we pleased.

He has a lot of character (for me a plus!) as displayed by his rather eccentric page video; but he's also a kind, warm-hearted and generous soul.

Great place to relax and immerse yourself in a Mediterranean holiday vibe with some of Raul's Jazz music playing in the background.. Location is ideal, a 5 min walk from Chueca station, so right in the middle of the action!\r\n\r\nRaul was always cordial but never intrusive. He shared everything: from his food, to his living space and his stories; usually with a glass of alcohol or two, or a Spanish snack on the side.

It is located in an area that has a lot to offer in terms of various cuisines and nightlife options. Raul is also a very good resource if you need help planning a night out or deciding where you should have your tapas.\n\nThe apartment is very well decorated in my opinion and is kept clean and tidy. I am asthmatic and suffer from allergies as well but had no issues during my stay. Like he mentioned, Raul owns a cat but it is a Sphynx so you don't need to worry about fur being everywhere. Tip: Sphynxes still secrete the allergenic cat protein that makes your eyes itchy or red but you will be fine once you remember to wash your hands after playing with her. I played with the cat a few times and never had any issues. Both Raul and his cat were very respectful of my space and were only around when I wanted them to be.\n\nThe room that I stayed in is very spacious and well heated. Although I did not need to use it, I noticed that there was a portable A/C unit that could be used in warmer seasons. The bathroom is also spacious, heated and comfortable to use. The kitchen is also stocked with the basics (coffee, breads, eggs, milk etc). If you have any special preferences such as needing soy/almond milk instead of regular just let Raul know and he will help you out.\n\nYou might have also noticed that Raul offers free massages. I took him up on the offer an was not let down. He was very professional, respectful and best of all experienced. He is a certified therapeutic masseuse and has a special room that is equipped with a massage bed. In my case I really needed it because my muscles were ridiculously sore after spending the entire previous night out eating,drinking and dancing in Madrid.

She has limited English, but was very patient with my even more limited Spanish! She is very knowledgeable about the city, and was able to direct me to the perfect place to purchase the authentic Spanish fan I had been seeking (Casa Diego). Her apartment is in a lively neighborhood close to museums and shopping, but the room faces onto a quiet courtyard, so no problems with noise. It was very hot in Madrid during my stay; but while there is no air-conditioning, the room stayed cool with the help of an electric fan. The room is very spacious as described and the bathroom next door was for my use alone. Ample hot water and pressure made for my first decent shower since arriving in Spain the month before. I took Charo up on her offer to drive me to the airport for 30 Euros (the fixed price in Madrid that a taxi charges for an airport ride). She got up at 6 am to drive me, and at that hour the trip took less than half an hour. I got to the airport 2 hours before my flight was scheduled to depart; but it took over an hour to check in and I made it through security just in time to board. Based on this experience, I would suggest that Charo tell furure guests to plan on arriving at least 3 hours before an international flight out of Madrid.

Tolle Gegend, abends ist auf den StraÃen viel los (\"Soho\" von Madrid). Nachts und morgens war es im Haus und in der Wohnung aber angenehm ruhig. Wir waren zu zweit und hatten zwei ineinanderÃ¼bergehende RÃ¤ume mit einem Doppelbett und einem Etagenbett. Da die Zimmer auf einen breiten Lichtschacht hinausgehen, sind sie sehr dunkel. Im heiÃen Sommer stÃ¶rt das aber wenig. Alles sehr einfach und sauber. Bad und KÃ¼che gleich nebenan. Charo hat uns zur angekÃ¼ndigten Zeit in der Wohnung sehr freundlich empfangen, uns Zimmer und KÃ¼che/Bad gezeigt, die SchlÃ¼ssel Ã¼berreicht und mit Tipps fÃ¼r Madrid versorgt. FÃ¼rs FrÃ¼hstÃ¼ck hat Charo uns Kaffee, Milch, Saft, FrÃ¼hstÃ¼cksbrot, Joghurt und Melone bereit gestellt. Mikrowelle und KÃ¼hlschrank sind vorhanden.

Good location, only 5 subway stops from \"must see\" Museums in Madrid.  \r\nThe professionally prepared photos in the listing created some let-down - only seating was 2 wooden chairs plus small table, no sight of any lounges, the window looks into a light-well with view of opposite blanked  windows, etc.\r\nAppreciate Charo's effort to get up at 5.30 am for our transport to the airport.

There my brother and I were left wondering whether we actually were in the right place, as nobody opened either of the two doors on the floor. Instead, for a good 5 minutes we had to stand there and listen to a man and a woman shouting at each other in one of the flats while their dog was barking really loudly. Finally, I called Charo again. She and her husband turned out to be the fighting couple.\r\n\r\nWe didn't get any recommendations from her, and the breakfast she provided us with were tiny buns wrapped in plastic, some stale biscuits and toast.\r\n\r\nThe doors in the flat are quite creaky, so the first time I tried to shut it, it made a bit of noise. I am a very careful person who doesn't use excessive force, so it really wasn't all that loud. Charo's husband then told me in a very aggravated manner not to slam the door, which I didn't. We apologised anyway and didn't really think about the incident anymore. But a few hours later, I got a message on AIRBNB from Charo, saying that 'they would not indulge such behaviour' and if we 'came to their house to make our stay more economical than a hotel, the least they ask is education'. We felt very attacked, especially since we'd apologised beforehand.\r\n\r\nOn quite a few photos that have now been removed, a spacious living room was to be seen. We were led to believe that this room was accessible to the guests, which it wasn't.\r\n\r\nBut we stayed at the apartment for 4 days, and for the rest of our holiday, Charo's husband was nothing but nice. We didn't get to see much of Charo herself.\r\n\r\nThe flat is easy to find, there is a supermarket in the same street, and you really can explore Madrid on foot if you stay there.\r\n\r\nOverall, our stay was very nice.\r\n","listing_name":"*** MALASAÃA B&B ***","price_for_night":45.0},

First of all, her residence was very difficult to find. Finally, after finding the building, she never even came downstairs to let us know where to go. After entering the residence, we were taken to a dirty, dusty room which was not appealing at all. Next, the man that she is residing with is absolutely crazy. He's extremely argumentative and aggressive.  We were speaking to Charro in English and he started raising his voice and telling us to speak in Spanish since we were in Spain. We went out to get a bite to eat and when we came back he came to our room yelling at us and forcing the house rules in our faces, and telling us that we slammed the door, even though we hadn't. He became very aggressive and started moving towards me and into my personal space and I held my hand out and told him to step back. I felt like I was a child being scolded by her parent, and honestly I felt like he has the capability of 'snapping' at any given moment. He then started yelling at my friend to speak Spanish even though she kept telling him that she didn't speak Spanish. He kept saying \"I know you speak Spanish, I heard you\". We were looking to find another place to stay, but it was too late and our wifi wasn't working. From then on, we decided to stay out most of the day in order to avoid him. We were so uncomfortable that it almost ruined our trip. We were paranoid to make any noise at all. Even on our last night, Charro was not helpful at all, and avoided even being around us. We didn't feel welcome from the first moment to the last.  I would not recommend this bnb to anyone. If you do choose this bnb, beware and make sure you speak Spanish and be able to recite their house rules. Susie/Helen.","listing_name":"*** MALASAÃA B&B ***","price_for_night":45.0},

There are french doors that open to a closed in space, so it gets a breeze but no street noises so my wife and I had quiet nights to sleep â and a TV to see the local news and weather.

Our original Airbnb reservation was cancelled less than 24  hours before we were to arrive in Madrid and we made the Airbnb reservation with Angel and Malinka the night before our arrival.  We got confirmation the morning we flew to Madrid and were so happy with our stay.  Malinka was incredible kind and knowledgeable about the city.  She can tell you which buses to take to get to different locations.  She has great stories and is so friendly.  She also provides you with breakfast foods and answers all of your questions (she will even help you plan your day).  On top of all of that, she gave my cousin and I free tickets to a wonder Flamenco show on our first night in Madrid and drove us to Atocha (the main station) one morning when she was heading in that direction.  She lives outside of the main city center, but it is peaceful and safe where she lives.  You can reach the city center quickly by the Renfe train, but if you stay out late like we did a few nights, the N11 bus will take you from Banco de Espana to her apartment.  The room was perfect and you get your own bathroom.  Definitely recommend staying here!!","listing_name":"double room, bathroom","price_for_night":31.0},
