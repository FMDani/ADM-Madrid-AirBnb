The accomodations are clean, well appointed and fantastic views of Madrid skyline.  We felt like it was a spa when walking into the flat.  We were greeted warmly and offered lots of information to get up and running for our short stay.  We wished we could have stayed longer and we highly recommend this location and neighborhood.",70
31018,6369,2010-03-23,84338,David,"Myself and Kristy originally planned on staying with Arturo for only a week, but when our plans changed, Arturo was very open to working with our changing schedule. Arturo and Simon were very friendly and helpful throughout our ten day visit. Our room was very clean and well kept. The view is amazing and the location is perfect. We're going to be traveling around Europe for another four months, and were joking that Arturo set the standards so high that we highly doubt we're going to be able to do any better, and it's true! Thank you so much Arturo and Simon, you were both very gracious, helpful and respectful of our space. I would highly recommend you and your flat to anyone traveling who wants a quite place with a great views, wonderful/clean rooms, a respectful and honest atmosphere. Thank you so much for being such an outstanding host! ",14

It's a wonderful room and bath in a great apartment with a lovely terrace. The location is perfect for me, especially given the easy access to the the Metro and the airport.  I look forward to returning!

41548,6369,2010-05-10,95579,Deborah,"Perfect airbnb experience as all others say. Lots of reasonable cafes or places to buy prepared food to eat at home in area. Room with terrace and ensuite prefect. Easy to get to from airport and to go all around Madrid on the metro. Arturo and Simon are the perfect hosts, helpful and hospitable (loved Simons mint tea and thanks for use of computer and internet) but also you feel you have lots of privacy. ",17
42550,6369,2010-05-15,106586,Nina,"Great host, great apartment! I had the bath to myself which was great. Neighborhood is safe and clean. Convenient store, bank, coffee shop and tapas bar nearby. It's so close you can crawl to it. Overall a great experience:) Also glad there is an elevator. ",52
45278,6369,2010-05-23,112662,Bo,We had a wonderful time in Madrid and the stay at ArturoÂ´s place is recommendable! Especially the terrace is a hit.,62
45618,6369,2010-05-24,18688,Charde,"We only stayed here for one night unfortunately, but it was superb value for money. Clean, sunny and spacious with welcoming hosts. It is not in the city centre, but Madrid is easily navigated with the metro, so that isn't really an issue!

Would definitely recommend!",62
57074,6369,2010-06-25,134713,Y. S.,"Great room in non-touristy location.  Convenient to the metro and has lots of tapas bars, bakeries, etc. nearby.",29
58370,6369,2010-06-28,103204,Derek,"Arturo and Simon were extremely welcoming to my girlfriend and I during our trip to Madrid. The proximity of his apartment to the airport, and the air conditioning are big pluses in our book. Also, having traveled elsewhere around Spain, having an elevator is also a big plus. The rate was extremely affordable, and Arturo definitely deserves the five star rating on this site. 

Two things to keep in mind when booking. First, while the Madrid metro is extremely convenient, Arturo's apartment isn't close to downtown Madrid. This may not matter to you, but as young-ish first time travelers to Madrid, we had some late nights coming back to the apartment. Despite that, I thought that being close to the airport was a nice compromise.

Also, there isn't a lock on the door. This wasn't a huge deal for my girlfriend and me (hence the 5 star rating), but if that's going to bother you, keep it in mind. ",18
93562,6369,2010-09-09,142487,Rachel,"Arturo and Simon were the most welcoming and accomadating hosts ever.  The apartment was beautiful and well maintained, the access from the metro was handy and just on the doorstep. The roof top terrace was amazing and the bedroom was spacious and comfortable. When we visit Madrid again we will definitely stay there. ",53
95547,6369,2010-09-12,105946,Hanzel,"Hello, great location and amazing space!! The metro is easy to get to the flat, thank you Arturo for having me stay in your flat. All the best Hanzel Moreno",43
97782,6369,2010-09-15,212797,Carlos,"There is no better place to stay if you are visiting Madrid. The metro station is 30 yards from the entrance of the building. If you prefer to take the bus, the bus stop is across the street. Either way it takes 15 minutes to downtown Madrid. The neighborhood is great, with bars and restaurants close by, but also quiet at night. We stayed  at the bigger room that has a private bathroom. It was as good as staying in a high scale hotel, with the convenience of having more space. The apartment is terrific. The terrace is wonderful. Finally and most importantly, Arturo is a great host, willing to answer any question and willing to give you tips to make your stay in Madrid outstanding. Thanks you so much!",14
105993,6369,2010-09-27,51776,Leigh,"It couldn't have been better. The room and terasse were lovely, clean, with a comfortable bed, and were convenient to everything. Arturo and Simon are completely marvelous as well. I enjoy both of them very much and only regret living so far away that I will not be able to visit them frequently. I will certainly recommend this room to anyone visiting Madrid.",59
115173,6369,2010-10-10,159607,Holly & Tyler,"We stayed with Arturo and Simon and had a very pleasant stay. While we did not meet Arturo (we kept missing like ships in the night) we were welcomed and entertained by Simon. This is a great place to stay if you are looking to stay in a more ""real"" neighbourhood that is light on tourists and heavy on locals. There is a great market nearby for coffee, tortilla espagnola, and lots of fresh veggies and the like. The room was great - airy, comfortable, and pleasantly connected to a bathroom. ",26
118924,6369,2010-10-14,184176,Evi&Hugo,"My boyfriend Hugo and I had a wonderful stay with Arturo! Right away, he welcomed us with hot coffee and a quick chat. He was kind and helpful throughout our stay, and the room was large and clean, with a great newly remodeled bathroom. Perhaps the best part is the location! It's a direct shot to the airport on the pink metro line, just a few stops, and then again very easy to get to the center for all the tourist sites. There's also a great large indoor food market just across the street, and a shop where you can buy hot food to go (El Sabroso). We bought a large roasted chicken, croquettes, an entire Spanish tortilla, and green peas for just 12 euros, and had an amazing feast on the terrace right outside our room. Highly recommended!",2
131856,6369,2010-11-02,185723,Pascale,"Nice place to stay. 
It's close to the subway to go to the center, direct line to the airport (15-20min).
The room is nice with a big bathroom ... the weather was not that good to enjoy the terrasse but it should be wonderfull to take the breakfast if the weather is sunny.
We strongly recommend :-)",76
138625,6369,2010-11-14,271439,Jordan,Best place to stay in Madrid. Love tbe rooftop views. Very friendly hosts. Right next to the subway stop which makes it very convenient. Great neighborhood with great eats. ,98
145579,6369,2010-11-28,257278,Laura,"Arturo and Simon were excellent hosts.  It was my first time staying at an airbnb location and I'll be sure to use it in the future because of what a great experience it was.  Mi novio y yo had a wonderful vacation.
The most important thing was that Arturo and Simon were friendly and hospitable.  It was like I was a regular renter and could use the apartment as I liked.  At first I felt a bit uneasy about this since it wasn't my home, but by the last couple of days I finally felt like I lived there.  Next time I will feel more at home from the beginning.  
Also, the place was quiet and allowed for a good sleep after a day of meandering around Madrid.  
There were places to eat nearby but we usually went out to places recommended to us by (Hidden by Airbnb) or a tour book.  Do not forget to ask Arturo or Simon about the market nearby.  
There is a public phone and an ATM in front of the building as well as the metro access available right across the street.  It was very convenient.  ",19
150241,6369,2010-12-07,199871,Carolina,"We got to Madrid on a holiday and we could not have the chance to meet Arturo and his couple. We  found a very nice appartment the room was big and the bed comfy :) We got there on winter so we did not use the terrace that in summer time I bet is great!  
Arturo was very nice when I contacted him to reserve the room and actually he was giving me some advices about where to eat in Madrid. We definitely want to go back if we go to Madrid again soon.. ",27
172479,6369,2011-01-19,326460,E. Alex,"Arturo was an absolute sweetheart! We arrived half an hour later than expected and he was still around to greet us. The room was clean, the bed extremely comfortable for two and the bathroom was by far the largest we had ever stayed (in Europe).  Despite the cold, the rooftop terrace was gorgeous and very comfortable. Arturo was kind enough to let us use the washer and was always very helpful. The apt itself is about a 25-30 minute bus trek, but in a very scenic and comfortable route. Would absolutely love to stay again! ",48
189700,6369,2011-02-28,353655,Bob,"What can I say that hasn't been already said about Arturo's place.  He is a warm, welcoming and considerate host.  For anyone who is new to Madrid, he is helpful about answering any questions and providing local knowledge to make your visit more enjoyable.  The neighborhood is great and has many local shops and markets.  If you are looking for a place to work out, ask Arturo for directions to the local public fitness facility - 4.50 euros for a clean, well equipped  gym about a 15 minute walk from the apartment. Staying here made us feel like we were living more like a local and away from the tourist/business crowds you find at the more typical hotel facilities. The room is perfect - big, bright and airy with a huge remodeled bathroom.  We had several lovely night sitting on the terrace drinking wine and taking in the Madrid night sky.  The subway is literally outside your door which connects easily you to any part of the city - including the Bajaras airport (super convenient). If you don't book here you are missing out on the best deal in Madrid!
Muchas gracias, Arturo.",97

211858,6369,2011-03-29,325772,Justin,"Arturo and Simon were extemely helpful during our stay in Madrid. They have a beautifully appointed apartment, well stocked and very clean. The terrace is gorgeous, my wife and I had several meals outside. It was also in a very convenient area. It is, as Arturo and Simon say, quite literally 10 steps to their door from the metro. Thanks Again! ",28
232786,6369,2011-04-20,379974,Geoffrey,"We enjoyed our stay in Arturo's Rooftop Terrasse room.  Arturo and Simon made us very welcome.  The facilities were very clean, neat and well-maintained.  The bathroom especially was modern and roomy.  It was delightful to be able to have our meals on the terrace.  We appreciated being able to have access to the apartment's laundry.  The location was very satisfactory, with access to the city centre by the Metro station just over the road from the accommodation.  The neighbourhood was both quiet and interesting.",17
240416,6369,2011-04-26,393135,Chi Chi,"Our stay with aurturo and simon was wonderful! The room was more than we expected and would rival any room in a top end hotel. The terrace was a lovely addition, it was nice waking up to sunshine. The apartment is super close to the columbia metro stn which takes you dt in less than half hour. It is also conveniently close to the airport as well.
Both hosts were fabulous and they made our stay comfortable and enjoyable :) thank you!",41
253678,6369,2011-05-06,186485,Angela,"Excellent place in Madrid! Arturo and Simon were great hosts. The room has a very comfortable bed (best sleep we've had in weeks), a huge bathroom and a beautiful terrace. Subway station right at the door (in nice area) with direct access to the airport. Would definitely stay with Arturo if we're back in Madrid!",5
266915,6369,2011-05-16,529463,Marc,It was a pleasure to stay at Arturo's place. The room and bathroom are clean and spacious and the terrace is perfect for having breakfast in the morning. The location of the apartment is a bit far from the center by foot but the metro station is really close. There are however a bunch of clubs 5 min away if you want to go out in the neighborhood.,60
278110,6369,2011-05-24,341324,Tim,"The apartment was great with access to the Metro just outside the front door of the building.  Arturo provided literature about Madrid to assist in locating and planning various venues.  The room with private bath was first class and the bathroom was large with a very large shower.  The use of the kitchen allowed meals to be prepared thereby reducing the overall cost of the stay.  The terrace was a plus for the apartment.  The room was clean, neat and tastefully decorated.  I would stay with Arturo again when in Madrid.",57
284115,6369,2011-05-27,145586,Kaiser,"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay at Arturo's top floor apartment. He is very kind and accomodating. The room and bathroom are very comfortable, clean and large. The best part is the access to patio, we enjoyed evenings there. He gave us information on the city as well. He helped me park my car as well. there is a Metro station in the same block.  I will stay again in a heartbeat. ",99
301653,6369,2011-06-07,359010,Beate,"We had a great time at Arturo's place. The roof terrace was overwhelming, Arturo was very nice with all his tipps and recommendations. Our room was very nicely decorated and clean. If we come back we'd definitely stay again at his place. Again, it was brilliant, thanks Arturo..
Beate and Traute",42
311551,6369,2011-06-13,251582,Joel,"Great place, wonderful host.  Bedroom has its own (big) bathroom and access to the terrace (as photos show).  Metro is literally outside the building.  It's a bit of a ride to downtown (two connections to get to Puerta del Sol) but it's easy enough -- I don't think you can find a place of equal quality and value close to the center.  If you're a nightowl and tend to stay out late (Metro closes at 1:30am), I am told there's a nightbus from downtown (or you can always take the taxi -- around 14 euro).  I would definitely recommend it to friends visiting Madrid.",31
325909,6369,2011-06-21,360220,Sebastien,"Very good experience. My wife and I stayed at Arturo's for 7 nights and we will repeat that experience anytime. The location is great although a little far from the city center (but close to the airport and Madrid's subway is great). The room is large with a nice bathroom, the terrace is amazing and Arturo's friend who were also staying there during  our stay (Rafa and Anniel) were very friendly. That helped us to really appreciate Madrid. Muy buena calidad a buen precio. ",90
333346,6369,2011-06-25,382675,Ronni,"Arturo was not there, but his friends took over, and they were very nice and hospitable to me. It's a great room, fantastic bathroom, really nice rooftop terrasse, and the Colombia Metro is litteraly at the doorstep. I wish I had had to stay longer :-) ",82
339699,6369,2011-06-28,492709,Jenn,"Arturo was on vacation but his roommate Rafa was an great host and an excellent guy. We really enjoyed hanging out with him.  The room was beautiful - hardwood floors, air conditioning, firm bed, garden terrace, private two sink bathroom.  Location was next to the Columbia train line which during the weekend takes about 20 min to get to Plaza del sol.  Would definitely stay there again.",49
353275,6369,2011-07-05,448298,Norman,"My visit to Madrid was spectacular, and the stay at Arturo place was extremely comfortable......when booking it would be very fesible to select the room with the restroom attached...that was convient.  It was truly the couples retreat. We had Peace of Mind the neighborhood was extremely assesble to metro, autobus and taxi's....This place I highly recommend. I am booking for next year.",52
360810,6369,2011-07-08,726600,Germano,Impeccable Hospitality and very comfortable place. I warmly reccomend it to anyone going to Madrid. Thank you Arturo,2

373264,6369,2011-07-14,629319,Caroline,"Arturo is warm, his place is kitted out nicely and the balcony is an oasis in busy Madrid. Don't over think it, just book. ",52
385877,6369,2011-07-20,793315,Tui,"My partner and I spent 4 nights at ArturoÂ´s place and it was our first Airbnb experience and it was definately a great one. The location of the apartment is great and makes getting around Madrid so easy with the metro stop literally at your doorstep. The room with the ensuite was beautiful and the roof top terrace was great. It was really clean and tidy and had everything you needed, ie kitchen etc. Arturo and his friends were also super helpful. definately stay again.",29
423784,6369,2011-08-06,815523,Gail,"Excellent bedroom and bath, huge compared to others.  Lots of restaurants and food to be found in the neighborhood.  The Metro stops right at the front door so the schleping of luggage is not so bad.  Most highly recommend staying with Simon and Arturo!",20

The bathroom was huge, the bedroom was really nice and comfortable and we were able to do your washing which was great. The neighbourhood is nice and quiet and has some really great restaurants. All up we had a great time, Arturo was an excellent host he spoke clear english and booked us a taxi to the airport. Would definitely stay here again.  ",14
579796,6369,2011-09-29,556748,Jean,"The place was simply perfect. 

Arturo was away, but his friend Rafa was a very generous and friendly  host. My stay  was everything one could wish for; a well appointed, air conditionned and above all quiet  room with a full bathroom and, of course, the terrace which was such a plus. 

I was tempted to write an awful review just to keep this wonderful place a secret for myself, my  friends and relatives ;-) but that would have been unfair. 

So, yes, I highly recommend the Rooftop terrace room of Arturo.

605342,6369,2011-10-07,184042,John And Nathan,"Thank you so much for this wonderful place to stay.  Arturo and Simon were away so we didn't get to meet them, but Rafa and Aniel were perfect hosts.  The apartment is convenient for everything and is in a very nice neighborhood with a beautiful market and good restaurants.  The apartment is exactly as described and is quiet and comfortable.  Really excellent and highly recommended.",80
627473,6369,2011-10-14,874563,Christian,"During our first trip to Madrid, we spent five nights in this beautiful bedroom. The spacious bathroom and the brilliant terrace were a big plus. The apartment is situated in a pleasant neighbourhood. We enjoyed the ""chocolateria Lyon"" just round the corner as a cosy place for having breakfast. Rafa and Aniel were warm-hearted and helpful hosts. We highly recommend this place and hope to return soon again.",94
641151,6369,2011-10-18,272881,Eric,"We stayed in this room two times during our recent trip to Spain for a total of 9-nights.  The apartment is located just steps to the nearest metro station.  This is ideal if you're doing an airport transfer as it is just a few more stops on the same train line to the international airport.  While most tourist sights will be a short train ride away we found this neighborhood to be pleasantly Spanish.  Without hotels there aren't many other tourists around.  Within a one-block radius you'll find a dozen good restaurants, a grocery store, a bakery, and a huge Spanish market with dozens of vendors selling cured meat, raw meat, fish, cheese, produce, and more.  There is a park a short walk away. Arturo was out of town when we visited so his roommate Rafa welcomed us in.  Simply put, Rafa is the best roommate you could ask for.  He is exceedingly friendly and we really liked him.   This room has fast wifi, a big comfortable bed, a door to the very large shared terrace, and a large en-suite bathroom.  There's also a good air conditioning unit in your room.  The bedroom is very quiet, no traffic noise, no neighbors, but you can hear some noise from the elevator when it is moved.  Arturo has left out some maps, guides, and outlet adaptors if you need them. We really enjoyed our time here.  We would recommend this room to anyone and everyone and would stay here again too.

The room and bathroom are very nice and light. The direct access to the nice terrace is absolutely a big bonus.

The apartment is a little away from the city center (20 mins on the metro), but with plenty places to eat and drink in the neighborhood. I If you are looking for a nice place away from all tourist crowds, Simonâs place is a good option.",21

The apartment is in a relaxed neighborhood, 15-30 minutes north of all the hectic touristy parts (20 paces to Columbia subway), still with easy access to it all (â¬13 taxi or uber off peak - but be careful of uber price gouging for busy hours - â¬48 at 9pm on a Friday night to the outskirts of the city center (taxi was still only â¬14). There was a nearby gym that offered 1 week memberships, with a pool (open swim 3x a day), boxing heavy-bag, free weights & machines, cardio machines & spin.

56520,26825,2010-06-23,143326,Yash & Dhwani,"Review for ""private room for one person"" - I had an opportunity to stay at Agustina's while I was visitng Madird (Website hidden by Airbnb) 

Pro's
- Very clear and prompt communication from Agustina prior to my arrival into Madrid on dates of availiability and on my various questions with regards to the accomocation and the manner in which to get to the apartment
- Apartment is in a lovely and extremely safe neighbourhood (the police station is 2 blocks away)
- Room was very clean and all utilities mentioned in the listing were availiable
- Agustina and her sister Natalia were great hosts and provided detailed subway maps and other city maps and guides on my first day there
- Very close to the city center....a few stops away from Sol which is the city center for tourist buses and Plaza Mayor. 
- Apartment complex has enormous clean pool which can be used in hot weather. 

Some things to consider
- To get to the apartment from either the airport or the Atocha Renfe train station you have to change trains once, consider taking a cab if you have a lot of luggage, I took the Metro as I had only a roll-on and it was not bad at all. 
- The shower area may be a little tight for someone who is quite large, I did not have any issues but something to consider (note: this is for the bathroom which is with the single room....not for the bigger second bathroom or for the apartment rental as that comes with both bathrooms).

Overall, I had a great experience renting from Agustina and thank her and her sister for my lovely stay in Madrid !",42

I regret that I didn't get to meet her in person because I'm sure we would have been sympatico.  Her representation of her rentals is absolutely right on --- what you see is exactly what you get. It's also very conveniently located -- metro, bus, etc. within a few minutes' walk.   I also made good use of the supermercado directly across the street from her building.

Thank you Agustina for all the good comunication and helping me find your building when I was lost outside.,21

Agustina was welcoming and very helpful with suggestions on what to do and 'must see' locations. 
Apartment is located nearby to Metro station, which was only a few stops from most tourist attractions.  
Supermarket across the road was convenient too.

266435,26825,2011-05-16,555653,Jodi,"Way more than I could ever have expected. Arriving from MAD airport is quite easy via the metro. There is a station change, but the metro is easily naviagable and the ones you will be using are accessible. Traveling with rolling luggage won't be a problem.  There are elevators and escalators. 

The neighborhood is safe, the neighbors are all friendly. 

The apartment building has a doorman, who welcomed me with the keys,  & personally escorted me to the elevator. Upon entering the view of the outdoor pool is breathtaking. It almost feels like a european Melrose Place, but without drama, lol.

Opening the door to the apartment, I drew in a breath while squealing with delight.  I was struck by how spotless it is! The wooden floors are gorgeous, the light filters in. I simply picked up my luggage to bring into the room I was staying in, and for additional care, I placed it directly on the little area rug by the night stand. 

The bathroom was so clean you could eat off the toilet, lol, but no, I did not actually do so. I loved the wall tiles in calming blues and the water pressure in the shower. A hand towel and bath towel were thoughtfully left for me on the bed. 

Agustina is a lovely woman, who not only made me feel like a treasured guest, but also spent time comforting me when I'd gotten flustered after a night of wondering lost after boarding a random bus in a freak windstorm. Her kindness was so appreciated. She was patient with my spanglish, encouraging when I'd felt deflated, and generous with her suggestions of an itinerary. 

I apologize for the delay in posting this review approximately a month after my return to the states, but I couldn't in good conscience neglect to share my wonderful experience. My memories of Madrid are so special to me. This was my first trip abroad as a single woman from start to finish, and I could not have asked for a better experience. Thank you so much, Agustina. I do hope to have the chance to stay with you again!

SPOTLESSLY clean and good location 6 euro taxi ride from Prado or 1 min walk from Metro. My only criticism is that I was surprised she asked me for 20 euro cleaning fee as I thought I had already paid everything through Airbnb...  Otherwise was a good experience and I would reccommend.",56
462492,26825,2011-08-21,767802,Carrie,"Lovely immaculate apartment in decent location with easy access to subway.  Augustina did make me feel welcome.  She provided directions to her place, suggestions to get around and some brochures.  

I wish she didn't smoke even though it was her own apartment she smoked in the patio to minimize smell.   Thus my reason for a 4/5star review.  

Her kitchen was not available for meal prep as I thought so there was a misunderstanding.  She did allow me to store some food.  She was generous enough to let me wash my clothes (she even helped!) and hang dry them.  

A friend of hers stayed one night whom I met, a lovely woman, and together they left 1 day early for holiday.  It was comforting to know she entrusted me to her apartment  and when she left she provided clear directions on check out.

While her apartment is lovely, clean, and in a calm location near the city center, the room I reserved was not as advertised. Her listing says the guest room has AC, which for me was a necessity in the middle of a Madrid summer in a room with no breeze or fan. However, the air conditioning was not working and when I messaged her about it, she did not respond. After both myself and AirBnB contacted her several times without response, I decided to leave  her place in order to get a better night's sleep.  To summarize, lovely apartment in a great location, but misrepresentation of amenities, poor communication on the part of the host, and uncomfortable temperatures in the bedroom. ",22

Yo me deje guiar por los comentarios para rentar este piso, pero la verdad es que no fue lo que esperaba. Voy a ser lo mas objetivo posible. El piso esta medianamente bien ubicado es decir no esta bien pero tampoco esta mal. El piso esta bonito y la verdad la zona esta bastante bien.  El cuarto esta bien arreglado pero por favor pÃ¡senle un trapo de vez en cuando hay muchÃ­simos polvo esta muy .OJO lean bien las reglas, si hay lavadora pero cuesta el aire acondicionado de mi cuarto no servÃ­a. Y para terminar Agustina puede ser buena onda a veces pero es una persona sumamente especial, lo cual al menos a mi no me hizo sentir como en casa nunca y siempre me sentÃ­ incomodo al coincidir platicar y hacer mis cosas en el piso. Varias veces le dije que necesitaba la lavanderÃ­a y me decÃ­a que maÃ±ana o despuÃ©s cuando ella llegara . Y por ultimo luego se vuelve incomodo el piso puesto que hay dos cuartos y Agustina renta los dos entonces estÃ¡n los dos cuartos ocupados y ella en la sala comÃºn lo cual te hace sentirte muy apretado. Y ojo con llegar tarde puesto que una vez salÃ­ y dejo las llaves puestas desde adentro por lo tanto cuando yo metÃ­ mi llave no podÃ­a girar y abrir, no obstante que llame muchas veces el timbre la puerta y a Agustina nunca nadie respondiÃ³. Cuando contesto finalmente el dÃ­a despuÃ©s me dijo que no habÃ­a ningÃºn problema con la puerta y cuando llegue al siguiente dÃ­a oh sorpresa estaban sus llave aunque esta vez ya me abriÃ³ ella desde adentro.",83

Empfehlenswert ist auch der Supermarkt direkt gegenÃ¼ber. Da die Fenster der Wohnung in den Innenhof der Wohnanlage gehen, ist es ziemlich ruhig und zum Beispiel kaum etwas vom Strassenverkehr zu hÃ¶ren. Auch ansonsten ist es eine ruhige Wohnanlage. Die Wohnung ist noch relativ neu, schÃ¶n eingerichtet und zweckmÃ¤Ãig. Ein Plus ist, dass ein separates kleines Bad zu dem Zimmer mit vermietet wird.

The swimming pool has a lifeguard, and is open all day, and very clean. Airco is only installed in the livingroom, not in the bedrooms, but with open windows we had no complaints.

61712,30320,2010-07-06,131301,Michal,"My wife and I stayed here for two days earlier this month.  It was our first experience using airnb and a positive one!  Iustina was in contact with us from the moment we booked the apartment and remained in contact until our stay.  She gave perfect directions to the apartment via the metro from the airport and someone was there to meet us when we arrived.  The apartment is really close to the metro and a quick ride to anywhere.  It was also wonderful to have airconditioning!  The only negative thing we noticed (and it is not a big thing) is that the bed made loud noises every time we rolled over.  Overall, it was a very pleasant experience. ",48

The apartment was large, the furniture were basic. The bedroom felt crammed with 2 beds.
The toilet and kitchen were clean. The ACs kept us nice and warm from the 2` C outside.
The refrigerator though was not working..
Overall a pleasant experience. Would still look for a better place if I were to go back to Madrid.

221142,30320,2011-04-09,367980,Crista,"the apartment was in a great location and exactly as i imagined it and a bit more.  the pictures do justice to the place.  The balcony is a nice and wonderful feature of the apt.  the light comes in as does the cool breeze, and at night when you want to block out some of the sounds of the street you can just close the doors.  

the kitchen was stocked normally and there were about 3 beds in the apt so 4 people could fit essentially if you count the couch..which i need fall asleep on a few times.  the only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is because i initially received the wrong key to the front gate, which was not really good to discover at 2am when i tried to get in. luckily someone else from pan america hostel opened it up for me. the only other thing was that there was no toilet paper when i initially got there. i had to go out and buy some.  i don't know whether that is normal but it is one of those things i would imagine as being apart of the whole thing.  the only other weird thing i think people should know is that you need your key to lock the door from the inside of the apt.  i just left the keys in the keyhole so that i wouldn't need to get them out every time i wanted to leave. 

despite those few things, i had a great stay and my host was very nice.  she met me at the apt on time and was super sweet.  she immediately replaced my faulty gate key and apologized.  i can't be angry about that, especially since we looked at both the keys and they looked identical.  it wasn't like the key was (Website hidden by Airbnb) just must have been a dud of a copy. 

either way, the place was great, the stairwell was unique and quaint and for those who hate stairs....there is a lift.  the security of the building was good. you had to open a door to get into wing of the building where the apartment was. one of the main subway stations is down the block and the apt is central to restaurants, bars, and shopping.  you will not be unsatisfied with this place.  it's comfortable, clean, quiet, and it is a steal at the price.  i would recommend this place and my host to friends and would stay again.

We had a small but fully equipped kitchen which was really handy for a quick breakfast before hitting the city. The building was very secure and the cleaning staff friendly and diligent! Although there were only two of us, there was enough space for 4/5 people to sleep comfortably. The only fault I can find is with the speed of the WiFi provided at the apartment - nearly impossible to use at times. Thank you very much for a great stay!

339065,30320,2011-06-27,716597,Jackie,We have just returned from a weekend stay at the above apt.  One of the main reasons we booked it was due to the french doors/terrace and view of street below.  Upon arrival there was scaffolding erected outside the building so when we opened the doors we were met with scaffolding and green mesh thus obstructing any view of the street.  I feel it was most unfair of the host not to mention this at the point of booking.  Location great but feel v. let down re above point.  We also had to drop off the keys ourselves the next morning to a place which was about 10 minutes walk which I felt was a bit poor.,86
358581,30320,2011-07-07,620645,Lora,"Upon getting there and calling the host to set up a time to meet for checking in, we were told that the building was under construction and we had a choice to move.  We opted to see the apartment first.  It was, in fact, under construction on the facade.  Our apartment, however, was not entirely the one shown in the pictures.  We did not have a view of the street with a balcony as shown - good from the standpoint that we wouldn't have been able to open the doors and enjoy the balcony anyways, bad from the standpoint of the fact that the pictures don't necessarily show the exact apartment that you might end up in.  The apartment that we were shown was of similar quality, however, so we were ok with staying instead of moving further from the center of the city.  It was hot and the air conditioner had a hard time keeping up, but we made do and used an extra fan.  Aside from that, the location was wonderful, and the host was very accommodating.",8

Dana was extremely kind and let us in early when our bus arrived at eight in the morning. I would recommend this to all my friends. The only con is the A/C does take a while to cool. The portable A/C unit does not seal off the inside from the outside, so the cold air can leak. Yet to be fair, we were in the middle of the summer in Madrid. :)",55

It was very easy getting here from the airport through public transportation. The metro train station is right around the corner from the apartment. I wish I would've had more time to spend here but I was satisfied with the place.",24
542641,30320,2011-09-18,508566,Amy,"This apartment was centrally located in a spot very easy to find and navigate the city!   Clean and the host was incredibly friendly, accomodating and a pleasure to meet, rent from.   A few things to note... during my stay the room required A/C due to the heat and required that a unit be set up in balcony entrance which meant that the doors had to remain open to the street.  This meant that I couldn't shut the street noise out to sleep and also that the apartment could not be locked if I wanted A/C.  I came in around 4pm to take a nap one of the days I was there and woke up to a construction man right at my balcony doors because there is also scaffolding on the building and construction happening.   This also meant that the apartment is technically accessible from the street whenever those balcony doors are open.  If you are single female traveler like myself, or have items that need to be secured I wouldn't recommend this spot.  I'm not sure what conditions are like in the winter (heating).   Also, no view from balcony since there is construction, scaffolding up (note).",34
580712,30320,2011-09-29,1034239,Mary,"Dana's place is just as the pictures indicated. She met me right outside the subway exit near the apartment at the time we had planned. She showed me how all the keys worked and offered me the use of the washer in another apartment as I had been traveling two weeks and unable to do any laundry.The apartment was spotless and includes a full size refridge, small cooktop, microwave and a set of dishes, utensils and pans.

The BEST thing about this comfortable apartment is its location! Five minutes walking distance to Plaza Mayor, two minutes to Puerto del Sol and ten minutes walking to Prado (or take the subway just two minutes from the apartment). I liked the extra space and three people could fit comfortably.

She also set me up with the wifi and it worked perfectly all three days I was there. Dana also provided me with a map of the area and helped with directions to a couple of places.

I highly recommend this apartment!",8
592169,30320,2011-10-03,819727,Lawrence,"I believe in being honest... so here goes !! 

Our Stayed in Dana's apartment from Sept 30-Oct 2nd, 2011 was pleasant. We arrived earlier than our check in time; 1 pm. She accommodated us but allowing us to check in at 11 am instead. However, it seems to be in another apartment than the one I booked. I was not aware this was going to be the case. I was disappointed about that. There were too many beds in the place for our liking. It was an apartment for about 5-6 people. So you can imagine the clutter.  Also, I was looking forward to the balcony. There was construction going on, which we were not informed.  I find that Diana was a bit short with us. She seemed always be in a hurry. 

The entire apartment was very clean and centrally located. We were able to walk everywhere. Diana provided my us with a map and some suggestions when touring the area. She also recommended some places to eat. We had one little issue with flushing the toilet. I called Diana, and she was there in 10 minutes. Upon our return later that night, it was fixed with no other issues. The kitchen was very clean and so was the refrigerator. Living and bedroom as well. There is also and old time elevator which was heaven for me!!!! There are a millions places to eat right outside the building. We went walking in the evenings into the night ... 3 (Website hidden by Airbnb) in the morning. One the door is locked you don't hear much from the outside.. 

Will I rent from her again ... YES!!!!

The apartment was an interior unit (not the one with the balcony with the photos). It was immaculately clean, fresh towels and sheets, comfortable bed, and a practical kitchen and bath. The airbnb description says there is no internet, but once I found the right network, I had a perfectly fast connection.

I had asked Dana about noise, and she recommended the interior room (no street noise). However, the walls are pretty thin, and I was awakened during the night by an argument between Mireya and her boyfriend next door (They finally made up, and I hope he doesn't leave her stranded at a bar again--I mention the details to communicate how much one can hear through the walls!) But this is pretty common in older buildings in the center of Madrid. The location is so fantastic and convenient, the price so amazingly low, and Dana so professional, that I would stay there again!

Anyway, this is a great apartment right in the middle of things. A lot of restaurants, bars, shopping, tourist sites, etc. all within walking distance. Public transportation is also right there, but I ended up walking everywhere. Madrid's a good city for that.

The apartment is so conveniently located that I was able to walk everywhere, and because it is minutes away from the Sol, I got an intimate first look of the lively night life in Madrid. The city has an amazing public transportation system which is very well marked and navigating through the metro system turned out to be much easier than I thought. There is also the fantastic rail system. I was able to take day trips to Segovia and Toledo via the high speed train for very reasonable prices. I  thoroughly enjoyed myself, and would definitely return in the future. ",44
2741100,30320,2012-10-28,3677192,David,"Overall, our stay was incredible.  We greatly enjoyed the apartment, found the location quite convenient, and appreciated Dana's kindness.  We stayed for three nights (Wed-Sat) and enjoyed a nice home-made breakfast each morning (a grocery store is quite close) replete with fresh coffee.  We also cooked dinner one night and found that the apartment was adequately stocked for a simple dinner.

That said, there are a couple things that I think potential guests should know:

1) the apartment is not lived in by a permanent resident.  Rather, it is treated as an investment and seems to be rented, along with many other similar apartments, through Airbnb.  This means that you do not have to worry about clutter of another person's belongings, but it also means that the apartment lacks certain items you would expect in someone's apartment: salt, pepper, paper towels, etc.  

2) while the apartment was quite quiet on Wednesday night, it was quite loud on Thursday and Friday nights.  I currently live in the Village in New York City and am used to loud street traffic, but this was unbelievably loud and continued past 6 am.  I would stay again during the week, but given the noise, I would definitely think twice before staying over the weekend.

3) because it appears that this ad represents several units in the same building, the specific layout of your unit may vary, and I would not rely on the photos to ensure the precise layout.  The apartment I stayed in had the bedroom in the back which helped with noise, but I do not know if other apartments are configured differently.  This fact also appears to explain how there are 40+ reviews.

That all said, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend the apartment to others.",48

But it was very clean, had air conditioning and had all the cooking supplies if you wanted to do that. The wifi only worked in the bedroom. Dana was very professional and accommodating. It is run like a small hotel, rather than a b and b.The price and location are right but if you are looking for the quaint, old world experience, this isn't the right place for you.",84

Nice space, very clean, good run down of how everything worked. On day three of our stay we were greeted with additional towels. The location is prime. Just a few minutes from the main square. Tons of restaurants and bars, sights and sounds. When you book, the apartment overlooking the street may not be available and you will be given the option of a inside facing apartment. Price should probably change for the lesser view, but all in all, more than worth it with my last minute planning and the location. I'd stay here again. Thanks Dana and HAPPY NEW YEAR!!",3

Dana was very easy to deal with, and Monica who met us to give us our keys was also really friendly and helpful. She gave us lots of useful information about the area during check in.

The apartment is surprisingly quiet given its central location too! We were on the second floor but the apartment block has a little lift, handy for bringing up luggage.

El apartamento en sÃ­ estÃ¡ genial; en este caso como solo era para mi madre tenÃ­a el tamaÃ±o perfecto para estar muy cÃ³moda, muy buen colchÃ³n y almohadas, el salÃ³n muy prÃ¡ctico con su sofÃ¡ y el TV es pantalla plana, no pequeÃ±ito como en la foto asÃ­ que aÃºn mejor :) La cocina estÃ¡ equipada con todo lo bÃ¡sico que necesites e incluso mÃ¡s.

The kitchen is fitted with the essential items for light meals but with so many good inexpensive cafe options close by you wonât need to cook.

The flat is located on a retail mall just off Plaza del Sol. You literally couldnât have a more central location to explore Madrid! All of the main sights are within easy walking distance. 

The flat is well equipped and very comfortable for a couple to stay in. It has a little kitchenette but we didnât use it as the flat is just around the corner from a huge number of bars and restaurants. 

Generally the flat is very quiet but the cost of staying in this supper central location is you do have occasional noise during the night from people transiting through the mall and enjoying the Madrid nightlife! (note the bars etc are not on the street the flat is on)

Sofia was available via phone and email, which was helpful when we wanted to find out which restaurant had the best Paella.

Up on the fourth floor with windows to the inside court, it is also really quiet. I also enjoyed the area (Chueca), which is not yet totally gentrified, so there are nice bars and cafÃ©s and local people - although it is just neighbouring the truly touristy central spots.

Dear reader, one by one these fears vanished into thin air. Sofia, our amazing host has equipted us with all the info as to how to arrive to the place. Once we arrived with taxi, the house master awaited us and accompanied us to the flat. In the flat, we felt like strangers... but only for a few hours. The feeling of ""away from home"" has quickly changed to ""home away from home"". The flat is exactly the right size for a couple, and also OK for 2 good friends who don't mind sharing the living room as a second bedroom at night. Sofia kept constant contact with us whenever we needed her, which was also for basic things like towels or light bulb fixing. Sofia and we became such good friends that she granted us with a very late checkout, even though the next day arrival was confirmed. (Dont try it at home hahaha).
Bottom line, I don't understand why people still go to hotels, when there is such a great solution like AIRBNB and such an amazing host like Sofia. You made our Holiday!!! (you and a few cute spanish men hahaha)",96

We never had to take a train (sans to and from the airport) or subway in 4-nights because the neighborhood is in such a great location. Everything fun and interesting is a short walking journey away.

Another thing (Maybe Lustina is already working on it) is that the internet acces did't work very well and cut averytime.

Everything in the apartment is top notch and high quality. Sergio was very friendly and accommodating. Please note there is no proper wifi in the apt.

193524,47957,2011-03-07,354615,Jo Ann,"Sergio was so accommodating! The four of us were arriving separately and at odd times of day, so he dropped the keys off at an off-site location to make it easy for the group arriving in the middle of the night to get in. Then when we had a problem with the shower drain he sent over someone to fix it. He also stopped by in the middle of the stay to say hi and see how we were doing. I'd say the only downside is that the apartment complex was under some renovation so there was a lot of hammering going on opposite our walls starting at 8:30 am. Very hard on the jetlag! Not Sergio's fault though. There was a library of DVDs so we could watch movies on the huge flatscreen before bed. BEAUTIFUL interior design--I think I have some new ideas for my next place!",57

Close to 3 metros making it very easy to get around the city.  The apartment is exactly as described and photographed.  Having two bathrooms was a nice luxury and the elevator was very handy for luggage.  After we left and moved on to the next city I discovered that I had left my travel wallet behind with my passport in it.  Sergio was very helpful in assisting me to have the wallet couriered to the next town so I didn't have to make a return trip to Madrid.  ,26

We were meeting our son, who had been studying abroad, and wanted accommodations that were large enough for the three of us to be comfortable for a week.  Sergio's apartment was perfect.  It was beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. There were two bedrooms and two bathrooms, a comfortable leather sofa and chaise, a dining table and a modern kitchen with a washing machine. My son could wash his clothes, and we relaxed with a DVD from Sergio's collection.  It was nice to shop at the excellent market nearby, and eat breakfast at the apartment before starting out for the day. The apartment is well located near 2 metro stops, but we walked everywhere. The apartment is in Salamanca, a safe upscale neighborhood with top designer stores, if you're into that. There are also small grocery stores, patisseries, restaurants and lots of local character.  Sergio is a very nice, easygoing person.  He lives upstairs and is very responsive to any concerns, and is extremely helpful in answering questions and giving suggestions.

Sergio provided great instructions to easliy get there from the airport by Metro and had set up easy access to the flat with the building porter who was waiting for us.   In the first coouple of days we had a few questions for Sergio and he was very responsive and helpful.
 
The aprtment is so nicely decorated it looks like someone just moved out and left plenty of space for the tenants, and it is nice and homey with a good big screen TV and all the amenities you need. It is also a very quiet apartment, which helped to get over our jetlag, and the bed is super confortable.
The other thing we really liked were that it was in a non-touristy area, so the location gave us more of a truly Madrid experience with small shops bars etc. but still very easy to access the attractions of Madrid by foot or Metro.  There is a Mercado just down the street, and be sure to try the Jamon Iberico de Bellota. Super!  Also Sergio recommended some restaurants close by.  One is El Estay which we loved. Check it out.  Great food , great wine and nice people.  We highly recommend this apartment!",66

It is very stylish and has everything that you can need. We had a good time. The details say that it is not on the street side. We did not realise that this meant it is on an interior wing of the appartment block so there are appartments very close on either side. We did find the noise from other people quite disturbing particularly the crying baby and the dog! We never met Sergio as we were let into the flat by his friend Daniela and had no contact during the week.,17
21121536,47957,2014-10-12,5258146,Sarah,"We originally rented Sergio's two bedroom apartment for one month (our reservation was made about three months in advance). He cancelled our reservation a few weeks before our arrival - with no explanation. To make up for it, he offered us his own apartment in the same building but on the fourth floor. It is a gorgeous place and recently renovated. He has very good taste. Overall we liked it very much, but were disappointed by the original cancellation because we had to give up the extra bedroom. That meant telling our friends who were going to spend a weekend with us that there was no room for them. We also missed a few of the amenities described such as a DVD player, toaster oven, coffee machine, and the American phone number. He told us that the bed was a queen, but it was definitely a full. We had a Spanish friend look at it, and also said it was smaller than a queen. The windows are well insulated but there is still some noise from the interior patios. This is apartment living so be forewarned that it is not always quiet, especially on the weekends and if you want to open the windows. The building's doorman is very friendly. We felt very safe in the building and neighborhood. It has excellent public transportation nearby. In addition to the metro, I highly recommend the bus, especially to go to Atocha (number 26). I think these apartments would be a great choice for short term stays.",5

Sergio's apartment has two bedrooms and two baths.  I was told by my nephew, a very observant mechanical engineer, that the apartment was really quite spectacular, that he didn't need earplugs to sleep (as one so often does in European cities) and that everything about the apartment was as he expected it would be.  

My experience as far as exchange of e-mails with Sergio was very pleasant.  Sergio answered any of my questions almost immediately -- and my nephew, who also communicated by e-mail with Sergio -- said that any questions that he had were immediately answered.

But with that, he knows to give you privacy.. 
Could work a bit more on cleaning, even though most of the areas are good.
Two things to be considered, the climb up the stairs, which isnt bad at all if you are ready for it and without big baggage.. And the noise issue.. The spanish houses are build in a way that you can hear your neighbores breath.. So that can be a problem when there are his guest in the house.

This home couldnÂ´t be better located, right in the center of Gran Via and AlcalÃ¡, in the heart of Madrid ... Next to the best chic museums and restaurants, in Chueca neighborhood. 
A very ""Arty"" place of course.

296811,70059,2011-06-04,525526,Alex,"This is a very good location for a number of reasons. Walking distance to Plaza Espana, Calle Princesa and Gran Via, which means relatively quick access to restaurants, supermarkets, Royal Palace, ATMs, and Plaza Espana metro station. We had purchased a few bus tours on Viator, which were served by Julia Travel, and the departure point was at Plaza Espana.

Kitchen is cozy, everything is provided - fridge, microwave, toaster, tea kettles. Plenty of hot water and good water pressure. Couple of drawbacks that come to mind is summer heat - Madrid can be quite hot and dusty, in an apartment without air conditioner that means open door to the balcony during the night. Which leads to another drawback - there's a fairly popular restaurant two floors down below, with Spanish tradition of late night dining that means loud songs and other noise till late at night. However, overall the experience was pretty tolerable.

There's a fairly large daily market (Mercado) at Calle de Reyers a block away from the apartment, it's a windowless building that's easy to miss. ",17

She filed a claim with AirBnB about the condition of a pot I had used, saying that it was broken and needed to be replaced. This was all a few days before I was set to check out and without speaking to me first. I would have liked a little more communication from her before going and complaining about me for reasons that were not even valid. She also fails to list that she lives in the unit directly next door. Overall a good stay, with a few annoying issues.",60

No hay calefacciÃ³n en el piso sino tan solo aire acondicionado en el dormitorio de tal manera q todo el piso se queda siempre frÃ­o. 

El punto mÃ¡s negativo es la CAMA. La dueÃ±a indicaba en su anuncio q era una cama doble pero son 2 colchones de 10 cms de grosor cada uno pegados gracias a una cremallera. 

No he podido dormir nada bien o casi nada ya que la materia del colchÃ³n no es buena y os aseguro que se puede sentir el sommier. 

El cuarto de baÃ±o es muyyy estrecho. 

Las fotos puestas en AIRBNB engaÃ±an ya que el piso parece mÃ¡s grande de lo que es en realidad. 

Estoy muy decepcionado y no lo recomendarÃ­a a nadie por mÃ¡s de una noche y nunca en invierno. Y ojo que no soy friolero. 

Yo he pagado por noche casi el mismo precio que un hotel de 4 *.

The apartment is compact but has everything you need to have a comfortable stay. The bedroom has a comfy sofabed but this is perfectly fine and we slept very well, especially as the balcony window had shutters to keep the light out as well. 

There is access to wifi which is very quick and was so important for us as we needed to do many things via email to get settled into life in Madrid. There is also a tv with many channels and a music system for entertainment.

The kitchen is equipped with all the crockery,cutlery and kitchenware you will need and the dining table around the corner from it is spacious with room for four people to sit if it is pulled out.

There is no separate living space but we did not find that a problem as we were happy to relax on the sofabed and of course, if you are visiting Madrid, you want to be out and about rather than inside. The shower is powerful and has plenty of hot water.

One of the very best features is the location. The apartment is very well situated for transport. Just twenty metres from the front door of the building is a lift giving access to the Plaza de Espana metro station and you can be on the platform for line 10 in about 2 minutes from leaving the front door of the apartment.

Gran Via is less that 5 minutes walking distance with a wide range of shops and restaurants. From there it's an easy stroll to the Royal Palace with some nice parks and open areas.

Diana was always available to help if we needed it and we enjoyed her warm Spanish hospitality. Thanks so much Diana! Your apartment is highly recommended for an enjoyable and pleasant stay in Madrid.

The area is lively and trendy with a lot of nice restaurants and shops. Diana herself was very hospitable host and gave us good instructions for the flat. The flat was big enough for two persons and it was furnished with  everything you need on a short stay. One of the problems was an old electric system. If there were too many electric devices on at a same time the electricity went off. Fortunately we were always able to switch in on by turning the main switch back to ""on""-position. Also the double bed had seen its better days but we slept well though. All in all: good experience and would recommend it to couples on a short visit to Madrid!",64

Diana is a very friendly host who was very understanding when we had difficulties concerning the check-in time, thank you again!
 
The only issue we had was the noisy street at night. The house is located at a corner with dumpsters and the garbage collection happens in the middle of the night.

The bathroom is small but clean, comfortable and has extra toiletries. The bedroom is quite cozy and feels integrated with urban life, with its window facing the busy street - it has the metro stop right next door, as well as a wide choice of affordable restaurants and vintage shops.

The flat is very well located in the main center of Madrid, just near plaza de espagne. It took us only 35 min by metro from airport. 
Air con is working well, you also have two keys (that is handy when your are 6 people). We didn't stay a lot in the flat but it's a good opportunity to visit the city and enjoy spain.

Being so near la gran via makes life easy in Madrid. Great nightlife and food everywhere. Walking distance to the royal palace and parque del sol. Plaza mayor is about a 10 minute walk from the apartment. El retiro park is a 10 minute metro ride (about 5 stops) and the metro is a 30 second walk from the apartment ( plaza de santo Domingo). The apartment has 2 single beds (a little rough for us being a young couple) and a couple couches that turn into beds. A great place to stay if you plan on mostly just leaving your stuff in the apartment and getting lost in Madrid for your stay. Raquel was nice enough to have a converter for some of your electronics, a coffee maker, iron, clean towels, and a washing machine (no dryer, not a thing in a Spain I guess. Air dry) the shower does get a little cold as it is in not in its own enclosed bathroom but basically part of the bedroom. Not a lot of hot water (10 minute shower at most) which is rough because the first thing I wanted after 18 hours in planes was a long, hot shower. The wifi was pretty spotty (it works best in the living room, not in the bathroom, and very slow in the bedroom). In summary I would stay here again no question. The location was just too perfect and central. Raquel was very easy to communicate with also, even with our late check in after midnight. Thank you for everything Raquel!",56

The apartment was as shown in the picture and was located on 3rd floor (There was an elevator to use). Check-in was smooth and Raquel was there to receive us on time. Apartment was clean and had all the amenities promised (like utensils/cutlery, microwave oven, fridge, electric hob, washing machine, hair dryer, cloth hangers, AC/heaters, toiletries like napkins / towels and bed linens. Oh even an umbrella).

The location was great and had 5 metro stations (Plaza de Espana, Santo Domingo, Callao, Opera and Sol) and 1 bus terminus (Callao) in the close proximity.  There were numerous supermarkets in the vicinity. Yet the house was calm and quite (may be because it was not facing the street).

Pros:
1. Apartment is as showcased by host.
2. Good amenities provided
3. 2 bedrooms (though small in size, they are decent enough)
4. Great location and ease of connectivity by metro/bus
5. Great hospitality by host

Cons (but not deal breakers):
1. Internet speed might be bit disappointing sometimes as the router is in the other unit of the apartment (but host confirmed to address this immediately after I vacated).
2. Small kitchen sink that might be annoying for a regular user.
3. Toilet and bathrooms do not have doors. The doors of bedroom are of plain glass. So, you might have privacy issue when you stay with others.",21

Raquel is a great host. She was always very easily accessible, made it easy for us to check in and out, was very accommodating, and was everything we could have asked for in  a host. 
The location was great. It is a very central location in the city and right next to two metro stations. We were one street away from Gran Via, close to Puerta del Sol, close to supermarkets, and about a 15-20 minute walk from most everything in Madrid. We were about a 10-15 walk to Comillas University (ICAI/ICADE) and a bit shorter if you take the metro. There's even a great nails/massage place right across the street.

The building was nice with an elevator. The apartment was a bit small but perfect for two people who know each other well. The apartment is fairly basic but for the price and location, you cannot get much better. My only complaint is sometimes the electric would go out if you have a lot of items on at once. When this happened, you just need to turn off and back on the electric switch and the problem would be fixed. Besides this, after living here for over 2 months, I highly recommend this place.

Thanks for a great stay Raquel.

Best,

The apartment simply didn't feel fresh and clean but rather neglected and empty which is not what is being expected from a Airbnb experience.  There is an extra fee for bedsheets but there was no blankets and we were freezing on the first night. Bedsheets were smelling mouldy, there was no soap even to wash our hands,  bathmat looked old and unclean, there was not even a packet of tea or coffee, heaters were not working. Vincenzo tried to make it up to us by bying the missing items on our second night but dispite his effort we kept a general feel of discomfort for the two remaining nights.
Conclusion a nice space that would require much more attention and care to make it work.

Great communication from Vincenzo, he or his representative is always available if you need anything, and he was really fair and honest in all his dealings with us. Unlike other reviews we had no problems with towels or bedsheets everything was fine.

Only downside of the flat: there is little privacy between rooms as there are no doors to seperate the different sleeping areas. So great for a group of friends or a family but less so for couples wanting some privacy.
Also as Vincenzo mentions in the house rules, the walls are quite thin so any noise in the flat during late hours will disturb the neighbours. However there are plenty of cool places in the surrounding neighbourhoods to go out and have fun! 

I would definitely recommend a stay in this flat! ",10

The terrace gives a very different point of view of Madrid, from the roofs ! It is so appreciated to take the aperitif/breakfast on the terrace and chat with your friends from ""above the city"".
We were 6 adult women coming for a friendly week-end and the venue was very appropriate as it is really an ""open"" loft (no doors to rooms, but curtains). 
It was really appreciated to have easy check-IN/OUT, especially for the departure, we could leave the luggages as the flat until 5pm.
Only 2 negative points would be :
- the ""formalities"" to come in (name of all guests, contracts...) could be simpler
- neighbours quite ""stressed"" : a note on the door coming back from our afternoon Madrid
visit, knocking on the bed-rooms walls at 1am and were going to bed. We have respected the houses rules with no party at the flat and being cautious at night. We think noise isolation is limited especially when hosting more than 2 guests. However, it seems normal to chat and enjoy the week-end without music nor exageration when you come to Madrid ! 

Anyway, I will definitely recommend this place even with 2 those ""small"" limits, everything else is great !",83

Wir wurden sehr herzlich von Mercedes und ihrem Mann empfangen und bekamen sogar ein kleines FrÃ¼hstÃ¼ck als Wilkommensgeschenk, das uns nach der langen Reise sehr gelegen kam. Das Appartement ist, so wie auf den Bildern, sehr ansprechend, gemÃ¼tlich und sauber. FÃ¼r zwei Personen bietet das Estudio ausreichend Platz und ist durch die groÃe Fensterfront mit genÃ¼gend Tageslicht versorgt. Besonders gut fanden wir, dass die Wohnung Rolladen hat, sodass einen die StraÃenlaterne auf der StraÃe gegenÃ¼ber nicht vom Schlafen abhielt. Das Bett bzw. die Schlafcouch ist sehr bequem, jedoch fÃ¼r meinen 1,92m groÃen Freund ein kleines bisschen zu kurz gewesen. Das Badezimmer lÃ¤sst keine WÃ¼nsche offen und auch die KÃ¼che bietet mit ihrer Grundausstattung die perfekte MÃ¶glichkeit um die ein oder andere Mahlzeit zuzubereiten. Obwohl sich die Wohnung in einer belebten Gegend befindet, war es verhÃ¤ltnismÃ¤Ãig ruhig! Der Standort war perfekt um nahezu alles zufuÃ zu erkunden oder schnell zu einer U-Bahn Station zu gelangen. Ein groÃer Pluspunkt war fÃ¼r uns die NÃ¤he (5-10 Minuten zufuÃ) zum Bahnhof Atocha, von dem der 24h Express-Bus zum Flughafen abfÃ¤hrt.
Alles in allem hat uns der Aufenthalt sehr gut gefallen und wir wÃ¼rden das Estudio Museo Dino jederzeit wieder buchen und es weiterempfehlen.

The sofa bed was very comfortable, and the hosts also provided a cot for our third person - this was comfortable and on wheels; it easily folded up, so we could store it away very easily during the day. The apartment was very close to the Atocha train station and the major museums, but it is a little bit further away from downtown Madrid.

276448,82481,2011-05-23,43078,Darrell,Mercedes place was great.   Great location and very comfortable lodgings.  The metro is nearby along with cafes and stores.   Mercedes even suggested a great place to watch Flamenco dancing and some sites to see.   We were only in Madrid for two days but made the most of it with her help.,29
301883,82481,2011-06-07,50975,Viktor,"Mercedes studio is a haven. Tucked away on a quiet street, but so close to public transportation and a hop and a skip to that wonder of a park, El Retiro. The studio has a fully equipped kitchen and a nice, bright, clean bathroom and the bed is very comfortable. 

Mercedes is so warm and very helpful. She grew up in Madrid, so she knows the city well.

You will feel like you're in your own hotel room as you have a separate entry to your place and Mercedes lives just across the hallwayâshe's usually available if you just knock at her door. If you're a runner like us, this is a little gift from Madrid, the shady perimeter of El Ritero is about 3 miles and it's fun to do a double lap around the park. 

Thank you Mercedes, you helped make our stay in Madrid more memorable and comfortable.

322676,82481,2011-06-19,668411,Marcia,"This lovely Central Madrid studio apartment is a wonderful place to stay, located within a short walk of the Prado, the Reina Sofia, good shopping, and pleasant restaurants, many of which have outdoor seating. But, best of all, it is very close to the Parque del Retiro, one of the most beautiful city parks in existence. The studio is within a very short walk of Madrid's Metro.

The accommodations are extremely comfortable and attractive. Wireless internet is available. Follow the instructions your host gives on how to refresh the air in the apartment first thing in the morning and you won't miss air conditioning at all -- it was in the mid-90s during my stay and the apartment stayed comfortably cool all day.

Your host is a native Madrilena and is very knowledgeable about interesting things to see and do. Her English is very good!

The location is unbeatable: a stone's throw from Retiro Park, and central to everything --you can walk nearly anywhere you'd want to go, and a good metro stop is very close by if you need to head further afield.  Mercedes is a wonderful hostess --so generous with her recommendations about interesting places to visit and restaurants you might not notice on first glance, but which become instant favorites. I would stay here again with pleasure. Thank you, Mercedes, for your lovely hospitality! ",44
360592,82481,2011-07-08,687122,Pat,"Mercedes was an extremely friendly and helpful host, and the apartment is perfect for exploring Madrid.  Once she had an idea of what we were looking for (I wanted to visit from Ernest Hemingway shrines) she was always ready with some tips or advice.
The apartment's central location is great, as even when we were lulled into oversleeping thanks to the ridiculously comfortable bed, we could walk just about anywhere (Museo del Prado for example) within about 15 minutes.  The fact that the place is just across the street from Parque del Buen Retiro meant we could also avoid some of Madrid's busy streets when going site seeing.
I will definitely try to stay here again on my next trip to Madrid.

Thanks,
Pat and Laura.",21

It is in a perfect location near Retiro park and there is a metro stop less than 5 min away to access any other part of Madrid (even though walking anywhere is quite easy.) The area is very safe and the apartment itself is secure. For being in a big city, it is very quiet and relaxing The bed (double) is extremely comfortable and there is plenty of space to store luggage and clothes. The bathroom and kitchen are very clean and have plenty of amenities. 

My boyfriend and I stayed in the apartment for a few days before our tour of Spain and are planning on returning at the end of our trip. 

Finally, Mercedes is a fantastic host! She gave us directions to the apartment and because she lived next door she was easily available if we had any issues (which we didn't.)

The studio is spotlessly clean and ordered well.
Mercedes is nice, welcoming and knew how to inform us about places to be visited, restaurants etc....
The studio is situated just a step from the Retiro  park (the biggest park of Madrid). We recommend you to visit the park on Sundays.
The place is very well served by the subway and the buses.

Our last advice, if the studio is available you can reserve it unguardedly.

At the same time, it enables guests to see normal Madrid life away from the tourist centres as there are several local shops, cafes, etc  in the area. The studio is well appointed although a little on the small side. Our host, Mercedes, was very helpful in suggesting places to see that are not on the usual tourist trail e.g. Residencia de Estudiantes and places to eat good tapas! Thank you Mercedes for a very pleasant stay. ",29

Everything you would want to see - from Plaza Mayor to the Prado is within easy walking distance - 20 minutes tops!  Many restaurants and shops in neighborhood.

The apartment is so clean, cozy, and modern.  Well equipped to cook if you would like.  Internet is fast and free.  The bed is so very comfortable.  It was very quiet.  You will need your alarm if you are on a schedule - very easy to oversleep!..

Best part is Mercedes is a warm and wonderful host.  A Madridian who knows the city and the sights and is very helpful with information on how to get to the best sights in the fastest time.

904642,82481,2012-02-06,1321640,Allison,"Mercedes is a lovely person and a delightful hostess, so I want to be able to give her apartment a fantastic review. The apartment is teeny tiny, newly remodeled, dark, and a good choice for someone who is not claustrophobic.  Those descriptions may sound contradictory but a careful review reader who parses each word will be fully informed and better able to determine if this is the place for him/her. The apartment is actually a single room on the interior air shaft of a beautiful old Madrid apartment that Mercedes occupies.  While visitors have a separate door and key, you do enter her apartment to get to your room.  Once you have seen Mercedes' gorgeous sun and light-filled rooms on the other side of the entry hall, your room feels even more cell-like.  One mandatory for me is wireless Internet access and that was a problem during my visit.  Mercedes was apologetic and tried to help but her network remained a problem throughout my stay.  In order to check the day's weather, without internet, you have to lean way into your air shaft window and try to see the sky---difficult.  There is also an odd smell, like sewage mixed with curry, that bubbles up from the shower drain and permeates the space.  The one window does not bring any light into the space but opening it did provide some relief from the smell, even if it also brought cold in. On the plus side, the remodel is new, the bed is comfortable, the kitchen is easy to use and stocked with Ikea basics, there is a generous wardrobe for clothes, and the towel warmer in the doll-like bathroom keeps the whole apartment warm and dries socks and delicates (and warms towels for shower--also provided).  The bery best part about the apartment is Mercedes, her kindness, and her wonderful suggestions for seeing Madrid.  ",60

Private entrance to the studio from the foyer of Mercedes' apartment, on the third floor of a nice building. Has an elevator too. We loved being close to the Metro and also one street off Retiro Park. We felt safe walking around the neighborhood, even late at night. Good for single traveler or couple. Compact kitchen was fine for preparing simple meals when we did not want to eat out. Everything we needed to enjoy a nice visit to Madrid.

Mercedes, the owner,  lives and works right across the hall, and is always available for tips about the city or any needs.  She is otherwise very discreet and quiet.
The space is just big enough for a couple but it is a little gem.  We had a lovely stay and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.  In fact, we hope we can go back very often.",38

1258373,82481,2012-05-10,2138292,Chul,"My girlfriend and I stayed in Mercedes' beautiful studio apartment for five nights in May 2012. It was absolute PERFECTION. With the hit and miss nature of hotel experiences threatening the enjoyment of our vacation, we decided to forgo the risk and stay with Mercedes.

The other reviews are correct: the space is cozy, so don't expect a palace (though we did note that it feels bigger than the pictures indicate). However the apartment is impeccably clean, charming, convenient to subways, and located in a safe and quiet part of the city away from the annoying tourist-y areas (for those familiar with New York City, think an Upper West Side-ish vibe). The well-equipped kitchenette was also ideal for our style of vacation -- we made light breakfast in every morning, and kept snacks for the afternoons and evenings, too.

Mercedes' home is in an elegant elevator building with secure access and a very up-scale feel. Returning to the apartment at the end of the day really felt like coming home rather than checking back in to a nondescript hotel room. The host herself is gracious and sweet, as well.

We would recommend Mercedes' apartment to friends, family and anyone else visiting Madrid. As long as her accommodation is available, we will always look there first when visiting!",10

The pictures of the apartment are exact and we found our stay at her apartment to be very comfortable.

We would definitely recommend her apartment to anyone we know. ",20

It's a little bit of a further walk, but not far at all, to the Thyssen Bornemisza museum and Retiro Park. The neighborhood is very cool - residential, tons of up & coming art galleries (like Espacio Minimo 2 blocks away),  a comic book store right near the nearby subway station, Lavapies, and affordable authentic tapas restaurants. As a New Yorker, I found this neighborhood to be like Madrid's equivalent of the East Village. The apartment itself is the perfect size for 2 guests (or a couple and a tag-along) and it is immaculately maintained. We didn't get to meet Felipe in person because he was out of town, but accessing the apartment was very easy and Felipe provides tons of maps and guidebooks to his guests. There's a very comfy bed, all the right stuff in the kitchen for preparing breakfast, and a washing machine. The building is also very cute and seemed extremely secure. I would highly recommend this apartment for anyone visiting Madrid who seeks more comfortable accommodations than a hotel and those who wish to experience Madrid like a real Madrileno. ",12

Felipe was kind and helpful, sending us maps detailing the easiest ways to reach the flat before we had even arrived. 

The flat was spotless and comfortable with all the amenities of home. Its located in a really hip neighborhood that's one of Madrid's most diverse. Tons of great little hole-in-the-wall tapas spots within strolling distance, as well as transport links to two major Metro lines. A ten-minute walk to the Prado, Reina Sofia, and Calle Mayor.

Would recommend highly - thanks Felipe!",43

We really loved the little decorations throughout as well as the nice closet and the layout. It felt like a great vacation getaway and not just someone's place we are renting due to all the nice decorative touches in the apartment. 

We arrived pretty late so Felipe had his friend wait for us with the keys. The apartment is very close to everything, and the neighborhood is fun and non-touristy. I would definitely stay at this apartment again and recommend it to my friends. ",82

Location was convenient for the museum triangle, as well as lively restaurant and cafe areas. We felt really at home in the apartment, as though it were our own, which was a pleasant experience having had a long trip to Spain from Australia, and not knowing anything about the city. Felipe's guidebooks were a great help. ",96

The apartment was clean and comfortable.We were close to a metro station (in a great little plaza) and able to walk to museums, parks. markets, etc.
We did find the bed quite short and our feet hung well over the edge, exacerbated by the fact that the head of the bed was not against a wall, (so the pillow would fall off if one tried to have one's head at the very top).  There was a full queen size futon in the living/dining area, but  I didn't see any sheets for it and  the short bed didn't bother us enough to go to the extra effort of making up the futon daily.
There was one other thing; every time we ran water, we experienced an unpleasant sewer type smell. It was not overpowering but it might  really bother some people.
We loved the Senegalese restaurant at the end of the street. The food was great and a great value. (It closes between 6-10 PM.)",57

The flat itself was quite comfortable for 2 people with all the things we needed for breakfast and snacks in the kitchen.  The washer was a nice bonus and let us do our laundry during our stay.

A very nice man met us at the apartment and handed over keys and explained how to use everything.  He did not speak any English and we did not speak any Spanish but we got by just fine using actions.  We were surprised how small the apartment was -  a bedsit really.  It is one of the cleanest, well equipped places we have stayed in.  A lot of thought has been put into providing everything you might need.  The shower recess is quite small but in good condition with good hot water.  Good quality crockery, saucepans, etc.  We had absolutely no problems at all (although we were a little hesitant about the area at first).  There are small convenience shops in the same street, a baker around the corner.  The apartment block was extremely quiet.  No worries getting to sleep at night.  There is a good washing machine in kitchen and we hung our washing on the lines provided over the courtyard.  The apartment is situated between two metro stations and is walking distance to the major sights.",59

Walking distance to metro / bus (Tirso de Molina and La Latina being the closest stations), and Puerta del Sol (the very centre of the city). Felipe was very helpful during our stay, giving us many tips to enjoy Madrid, thanks a lot!",73

The bed is comfortable and the area is quiet since the windows face a courtyard and not the street. The air conditioner works well as it was a little sticky when we were in Madrid. The apartment is clean and the kitchen has plenty of cooking utensils. We had a wonderful stay in Felipe's apartment. I would stay again and recommend it highly.,82

We were met to be let in to the apartment, and when we arrived earlier than expected Felipe promptly made a new arrangement for us to get in earlier, which we appreciated. The apartment is extremely well set up and equipped for a small space. It is spotlessly clean. The location is wonderful for getting around Madrid, both by foot and by Metro. A supermarket is only a few minutes walk away, as are bars and restaurants. I will definitely be recommending to friends, and I hope we can stay there again on our next trip to Madrid.

Felipe was so accommodating, having Angel meet us at the apt. about two hours after we had first contacted him. The place was clean and had everything we could possibly need. The surrounding area was nice as well, with many cafes and places to shop. I would recommend renting from Felipe. He sure helped make my first Europe experience wonderful!",75

We arrived a few hours later then we expected (traffic into Madrid on a Sunday night is kaos!) and Felipe waited for us with the keys.... We felt soooo bad, but Felipe made us feel at home.

Parking anywhere in Madrid is real pain, so dump your rental car.... I drove a few kilometres out of the city where street parking was free, and used the subway (there is garage car parking just down the street but it's â¬30 for 24 hours, which over 4 days seemed excessive) - only a few minutes from Felipe's apartment.

The internet is strong, the kitchen is fully stocked, the area is perfect, and (more importantly in July) the air conditioner works great. Felipe, we noticed that you turned the bed so the head is at the wall - this is a great improvement as is ends the fear of your head falling off the end of the bed. Did not meet Felipe, but his helper, Angel, was perfect both times. Would stay here again and again.",55

Felipe ordered us a taxi to pick us up early on the morning of our departure and the car was there right on time.   The area is a bit intimidating at first but after we got our bearings on  the first morning, we felt better about things. It,s a student/immigrant/working class neighbourhood with lots of little cafes and restaurants. We would probably not stay again, but only because of the size of the apartment. It would be great for younger people, but perhaps not quite so good for 69 year olds. However, weare glad we had the experience. It was our first Airbnb booking. Thanks Felipe.",58

The place was really clean and Felipe is really helpful, he will reply to you almost instantly. He also gave really clear directions on how to get to the apt from the airport.

The furniture was great; the bed was comfy and the curtains covered the sunlight that we got in the daytime. All the amenities were working just fine.

Ademas el anfitrion estuvo muy interesado en nuestro bienestar, cosa que se agradece.

Si tuviera que volver a alquilar un apartamento, no lo dudaria.",10
13931256,84719,2014-06-08,8233061,Max,"Felipe was very responsive to our emails and flexible. He let us drop off our luggage early so we wouldn't have to carry it around with us. He was also understanding about the fact that there would be a third person staying with us for just part of the week; he only applied the extra person charge for those nights. His apartment is small, but in our experience that is normal for Madrid. It is clean and stocked with everything necessary--extra sheets, towels, cooking utensils, etc. The internet connection is good, which we appreciated very much. The best thing is the apartment's location--it is easy to get to the airport by Metro (which we did on the way in) or by Cercanias at Atocha (which we did on the way out). We didn't find it necessary to use the Metro while we were staying at Felipe's apartment--we like to walk and all the places we wanted or needed to go to (museums, Retiro, other major sights, buses leaving from Principe Pio) were within a 30-minute walk. But it is very close to three Metro stations if you prefer not to walk. The apartment opens onto a courtyard shared with the rest of the building. During the day you can hear other people talking or watching TV if you have the window open, but for the most part the neighbors are quiet at night and we had no trouble sleeping. In any case, the windows could be closed and the AC turned on to drown out any outside noise. The shower is small. We are thin but very tall and found it a bit cramped. I mention this not because it was a problem for us but because some larger people might find it hard to use the shower. All things considered, we can confidently recommend Felipe's apartment--he's a good host and his apartment worked very well for us. 
If you stay here we highly recommend eating dinner at the nearby Gau&Cafe--it's on a rooftop just a few blocks away. Beautiful views and good food. ",98
14135743,84719,2014-06-12,13432783,Billy,"My stay at Felipe's apartment was short (2 nights) but very pleasant nonetheless. the apartment is perfect for solo travelers or couples and is fully equipped with everything you could possibly need. 
In terms of location, it couldn't be better as it's in my beloved former neighborhood of LavapiÃ©s (I lived in Madrid for 9 years!) and within easy access of other interesting areas like La Latina. The main museums are also within walking distance, as are a host of cool bars and great ethnic restaurants in LavapiÃ©s. 
Felipe was very attentive during my stay and was in regular contact with me to make sure everything was going smoothly. 
All in all I would definitely recommend his apartment as a great base from which to explore the city, whilst at the same time giving a very interesting insight into one of the most bohemian, working-class and multi-cultural neighborhoods in Madrid!",11

The location was a good balance between being close to la latina, the palace, plaza mayor, and the train station, and a longer but manageable walk to the Prado museum. The neighborhood was relatively quiet at night, but we could hear the neighbors occasionally. Felipe was easy to communicate with, and was accommodating by allowing us to pick up the keys early. My only complaint was that the place is listed as having a washer and dryer for clothes, and only after washing our clothes the night before we left did we realize that there actually is no dryer, so that was inaccurate and a bit inconvenient. But overall this was a good pick and I would recommend it!",32

During our stay we went out sightseeing in the morning, then come back for a nap and go out for dinner in the evening.

Flat was really nice and in great location and had a great recommendation for dinner round the corner. Terrace is great addition and enjoyed a few glasses of wine before dinner on the terrace. ",54

The house itself is very comfortable, the available space is used in a very clever way, everything seems well thought about. Also the terrace is very nice, with a great view. (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication with Vin and in our case the caretaker went very smooth all the way, which really made the experience even better.
I'd recommend this place for sure and when I come back to Madrid I'll start by looking if this place is available.",28
20607211,86042,2014-10-02,20161477,Kathryn,"We had a perfect stay in Vins flat, he was extremely helpful with our arrangements,and when we asked  to extend our stay he had no problem organizing this for us. We were a family on holiday with mixed ages( 80 year old gran too!), and each of the sleeping arrangements were very comfortable and discrete. Its also a lovely quiet apartment, a really peaceful oasis, so we were well rested each morning. At the end of each day ,the fantastic sunsets from the west facing terrace were just beautiful. The kitchen was a great place to cook and prepare,with everything easily accessible, and I always had company and chat from whoever perched on a stool. The area was so near all the main attractions, we really enjoyed walking around,but we could also use the Metro ,as there were 2 stops nearby. We were so lazy that we would walk DOWN to Lavapies, then get off at Anton Martin on the way home, so that we were STILL walking downhill! They were both lovely busy areas to explore,and we felt safe walking home at ALL hours. Thanks Vin,its a great wee place.",75

47219624,86042,2015-09-16,12866185,Thomas,"Vin is a friendly host who was very quick to respond to our last-minute request for accommodation. The flat is very tastefully presented, spacious, bright and the location is very central.  However, to justify the high cost that we paid, (same as any three-star hotel in the area), there are some important improvements I recommend, (and am confident Vin would accommodate). 1. Much greater cleanliness is required, this was in our mind not acceptable and easily solved. 2. A proper 3rd bed or mattress, my friend slept horribly on the one present. 3. Communicating the heavy slog up and down the 4 floors without an elevator, my friend has back issues and caused us some grief. And 4th, I seriously think it's poor form to charge us for towels and linen and late arrival when we are already paying for one of the most expensive flats in the area. Given the high price for this accommodation we simply expected more. Would I come back? Sure, but only if these requirements were met, there are many other offers nearby and competition is fierce.  Some elbow grease and a mini-investment and this place is tops!",69

We enjoyed walking around the area near the apartment. There are lots of cafes, tapas bars and shops and we were only 10 mins walk from the Atocha train station. Vin was very responsive to our queries. We found the living space, kitchen and living room very comfortable and practical. The only downsides were that there is only 1 bathroom and it is in the only real bedroom. My bed was in a cosy alcove, which was fine, but I did need to walk through my friend's bedroom to use the bathroom. For us, this was ok. But for others who need more privacy, it could be an issue. Also, the shower was broken. It held together for most of our week, and had goid pressure and hot water, but the tape fell apart the day before we left. I'm sure Vin will be fixing this.

PRO:
- Position: 5-10 minutes walking from Plaza Major, 3 minutes from the Carrefour and some 24hs under the apartment.
-Vin is very nice, precise and reliable.
-Fantastic terrace on the roofs of Madrid
-The attic is really cool and welcoming
-No problems with neighbors

CONS
- The apartment has only one private room with a door, so there is not much space for privacy.
- Only one bathroom with a boiler, that barely allows you to have more than 5 showers (5 minutes each shower)
- The apartment is on the fourth floor without elevator

Few very minor things like hot water didn't last long and keys were a little tricky to get hang of (front door and downstairs  both) but everything else was just great.

Close to some amazing restaurants  and the Museo Reina Sofia. A 10-15 minute walk to Chueca and various parks and museums.  Great for a couple or a family with one or two kids.  Vin was a great communicator and greeted us upon arrival.  A great value for the space overall.  Would stay there again, but with a smaller group or with my partner.  Everything we needed to make meals.  A grocery store is nearby and a market which made things easy.

CONS: Just a few little things: a tight space for 5 adult friends alnd only one bathroom, but we made it work since we are like family.  Lots of stairs for people that have mobility challenges. Clean, but not polished. Consider bringing your own pillows if you're picky.  Needs new blinds on the skylights - very bright in the morning if you're a late sleeper and if you have someone in your group sleeping in the loft space.  Perhaps an umbrella on the balcony or fix the awning for additional shade.

577215901,86042,2019-12-15,36799930,Guido And Sarah,"Vin's apartment is nice and very centrally located and is a good place for a short term stay in Madrid. It has a pretty view over Madrid as described and a lovely terrace. For a longer stay especially in winter we would recommend it only partially.  There are radiators in the flat, but the stone floor (that definitely looks very beautiful) stays cold and the shower capacity is maybe ok for 1 person, or if one uses little water, maybe 2. The flat is smaller than it seems in the description and fotos and the equipment of the kitchen is quite basic. However a really good thing for longer stays is the washing machine that we were able to use. The furniture has already seen better times, e.g  the sofas are quite worn down. We had problems with the internet- but Vin tried and managed to solve them super quickly, which we highly appreciated. We also liked, that the apartment has a lift! We can recommend the place, but think it is probably good to update the description and/or fotos.",68

Check-in and check-out was super easy. We could even do a late check-out (fair fee applies) which was very convenient as our flirt was late in the day.
It is listed as accommodating 7 people, however we were a family of 5 and the table only seats 4, which made meals a tight business.
The reason why I gave the place a lower star is because the bedroom really needs an upgrade, you can feel some spring in the mattress, pillows are beyond old and full of stains, and one day the duvet cover got out... the blond-stained duvet was not a nice sight. For the rate charged, the main room could get an upgrade.",61

The only problem we had was the smell of the dampness next to one of the single beds. There was a wardrobe next to the bed but the smell was so strong you could not hang your clothes or even sleep next to it- my cousin had to move to the living room to sleep. Apart from that, everything ok.",36

We tended to stay in the immediate neighborhood which was full of cute bars and restaurants, but did venture up to Puerta Sol for chocolate and churros :) The apartment itself was spotlessly clean and very comfortable and quiet - it was definitely one of the best equipped Air BNB apartments I've stayed in with loads of extra bedding, a good hairdryer, washer & dryer, lots of maps and tour books, etc. The nicest touch was when Alicia and Carlos met us and left out a little snack selection on arrival - we were starving after a day of travel and it was such a thoughtful gesture. I would highly recommend a visit to Madrid and using this apartment as a base!",32

The flat was very well appointed. It was very clean and user friendly. The location was excellent for exploring Madrid being close to Metro and also many tabernas for enjoying Madrid food and drink. We enjoyed our stay here. The best place we have stayed in on this trip. Thank you Botha Alicia and Carlos.

61250583,89954,2016-02-01,38462168,Nick,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was a great start. Both the apartment and the hosts were perfect.
Alicia and Carlos were very good at sharing key information before we arrived including suggestions on what we could focus on doing/seeing during our short stay in Madrid.  At the end of our stay they also allowed us to leave our bags in the apartment for an extra half day.
The apartment felt very modern, was not cramped (there were three of us), was very clean/tidy and was well equipped.  Although we ate out most of the time (loads of restaurants and cafes near bye) the kitchen provided all we would have needed had we decided to eat in.
Beds were very comfortable with good quality linen.
The apartment does not have 'views' from the windows but it is well situated in old Madrid and a few minutes walk in any direction will give you all the views you will need.
Metro line is a short walk away and taxi's are always around. 
If you are coming to Madrid for the first time (or coming back) then we would have no hesitation in recommending Alicia, Carlos and their apartment. 
Big thanks to Alicia and Carlos. ",48

Close walking distance to numerous things on my list to see as well as tons of restaurants and public transportation. The flat was perfect for us and was spacious.

It was clean, cozy and comfortable and close to everythingâ¦markets, metro, city center, etc.  Alicia and Carlos were excellent hosts and met us at the apartment when we arrived.  They provided us with guides, maps and advice on Madrid.  This greatly helped us navigate the city efficiently in our short 3 night stay!  They arranged a taxi to take us to the airport on departure since our family of 5 did not fit into a standard taxi.  That was very helpful since we had to take 2 taxi's from the train station to the flat.  The wifi was excellent.  The apartment also had the best shower with much water pressure, hot water, and big and soft towels.  I would only note that if someone is a light sleeper and slept on the couch bed, you can hear the building main door shut as residents come and go, but you do not hear that in the bedrooms.  Also, we loved the restaurant Tacos and Tapas which was a 1 minute walk from the apartment (a reservation is a must since it can only seat about 12 people!).  Highly rated, personable, and great prices.  Thanks Alicia and Carlos for a wonderful stay!",32

The hosts are very friendly and willing to help. As they had no other guests before us, we were able to 'check in' early. At arrival we found a bottle of wine and a bag of muffins. We appreciated that. In addition they gave us addresses of good restaurants in the neighbourhood.

To keep this high rating, it takes a lot from Alicia & Carlos especially when they just added a new member in their family. Congratulation guys. And Bravo! They give super host it's meaning. What stand out for me are communication with them, accommodating/reliable feeling and the location of apartment. To top them all, they have a car garage in the middle of city. That was the tipping point for me to choose this apartment.  This is the best equipped Airbnb (of 7) I have came across.",11

We arrived late after an exhausting day of travel, and Raul was waiting for us with dinner, a good bottle of wine, and friendly conversation.  He is the kind of host you dream about when traveling in a foreign place- welcoming, warm, helpful... and has coffee and breakfast waiting every morning! Don't think twice about staying here! I doubt there is a better place in the whole of Madrid, and certainly not a better host.  (Miss you Raul, come visit DC soon!)",84

Second, it is in the best location ever. Lots of great shops and restaurants in the neighborhood, and just a quick metro ride to the historic center stuff. Third, Raul is an awesome and generous host. Exactly what you want from a host. We've already recommended his place to several friends. Come visit us in SF Raul!  ",25

I only used the metro to get from/to the bus station - everything I wanted to do in the city was within walking distance, and there's a lot going on in the Chueca neighborhood itself.  The apartment is clean with tall ceilings, so it has a nice feeling of cool, comfortable space.  And Raul himself is really a great guy and very helpful.  Whether it was restaurant advice, a screwdriver, or a backup computer that was needed, he provided it all!  He also let me stay until the evening on the last day [since my bus didn't leave until late] and continued to make sure I was comfortable.  He's just generally a friendly, calm, open guy.

He is so so sweet. We talked about everything. On the first day, he prepared a delicious dinner and in the morning, very nice breakfast. His aparment is nice and cool, a great escape from the hot Spanish summer. Chueca is also a beautiful neighbor, very centrally located to everything. Stay here and you can reach the most important sites in Madrid by simply stepping outside. I feel so grateful to have Raul as my host and for everything he has helped me with (from letting me borrow his computer to sharing the stories of his life with me. I have definitely learned a lot from him as a person, and more importantly gain a friend. And please check out the ice cream place in Chueca (I promise you won't be disappointed; I have had ice cream from other places in Spain, this one is to die for). ",41
417344,92920,2011-08-03,383337,Joel,"Raul's place was idyllic for my trip to Madrid. Located about a 10 minute walk from the Puerta del Sol, and right next to the metro, you get the benefit of being right next to the action in a relaxing place. Raul's home is very spacious and relaxing, and Raul is a very gracious host. Overall, it was a fantastic experience, one worth repeating in the future. ",64
427678,92920,2011-08-08,590472,Miranda,"Living at Raul's house was such a great experience. He was so friendly and warm and made sure we felt at home. The house was beautiful and comfortable and within walking distance to so many main attractions. Also, the best gelato place was just minutes away. Raul was incredibly hospitable and helped with directions to the bus, fun things to do around the city, and he himself has so many interesting stories. I would recommend his place without hesitation because it really is a gem! ",64
475955,92920,2011-08-26,694448,Kira,"To be perfectly honest, our experience staying with Raul could not have been better.  Being our first Air BnB experience, we were a little nervous about staying in a stranger's home- but we could not have made a better decision.

From first contact, Raul was warm and accommodating- even accommodating a last minute date change the week of our arrival.  Day of, we found the apartment with no problems- he had given us fabulous directions. He helped us up to his flat (we were in the process of moving to London, so we were carrying a TON of luggage), and then offered us a beer while he explained the lay of the land.  He gave us a brief orientation not only to the flat, but to Madrid itself- providing us with maps of the neighbourhood, the city and the metro system.

The apartment itself is a great spot- big and bright, and the bedroom is very comfortable.  He has a whole shelf of maps, travel books, etc. to make the orientation even easier.  Raul made us breakfast every morning, and we had a key to come and go as we pleased.  What made the experience so memorable for us, however, was not the apartment, but Raul himself.  I cannot imagine a more hospitable host- a genuinely kind and engaging guy- he even walked us to the metro when we left!  If you're making the trip to Madrid, I would definitely suggest staying with Raul.  You won't regret it!  Thank you, Raul!!!",42
517282,92920,2011-09-10,583895,Benjamin,"Raul was the perfect host. I stayed in Raul's home for three weeks and from the moment I arrived he made me feel at home - very comfortable and relaxed. I felt free to come and go and to share Raul's home, often hanging out in the evening, having some wine and tapas. The apartment is massive and in a great neighbourhood of Chueca, but also being set back from the action, making it a little quieter and better for sleeping. I would definitely recommend Raul and his place to anyone staying in Madrid. Fantastic.",55

Excellent location, very close to a subway stop and in one of the better and happening neighbourhoods of Madrid. You can also easily walk to most of central Madrid's sites from here. The apartment is well appointed and has everything you'd need. The neighbours can be a bit noisy but, hey, this is Madrid (bring some earplugs if you're a light sleeper).

And Raul is a very welcoming and warm host. He's a wealth of information, is very friendly and helpful, made me feel at home immediately. My only regret is not having enough time to hang out with him some more.",55

I particularly enjoyed the last night when he has his friends over for his birthday - was a lovely evening full of merriment and enjoyable conversation.

What we loved:
-Raul was very responsive in emailing and flexible with our arrival and check-out time.
-Upon arrival Raul offered us a beer and we chatted for a bit about the apartment, neighborhood, and our travels. He was very sweet and caring, and treated us like roommates (we could use the living room and kitchen freely). We also shared some champagne with him as well one of the nights and chatted about each other's travel experiences.
-Breakfast each morning when ever we woke up (which varied as Spaniards stay up rather late).
-The apartment was in a great location (near great restaurants, gay and mixed nightlife, shopping, and just about everything central in the city). We walked everywhere and only used metro to get to/from the airport. 
-Bedroom was comfortable and clean.  He had nice towels laid out as well as lots of helpful tourist information.  

It's an old building, and the apartment has a small water tank. If you like super long showers, this might not work (hot water lasts for about 15 mins). It was totally fine with us.  

Overall, just an exceptional stay. Raul really likes to get to know the people he's staying with and we felt blessed to meet someone who knows Spain.

Raul is an excellent host, very respectful and kind. He can advice you about everything in Madrid.

It was a really great location too! We were only a few blocks from the shopping center. I'd say we were at most 30 min from the Prado Museum.

Because I fly standby, disruptions in my schedule occur.  He was very accommodating with me with regard to a problem getting to Madrid.  I arrived on the correct day, but several hours later than I planned.

I really liked my room.  It was a nice, big bed and had the most comfortable pillows.  I slept like a log in that room.

I'm a big fan of historic buildings, and I liked the rustic charm of the building.  Its location can't be beat.  It's so very close to the Metro.

I liked his choice of food...juice, tea, fruit, toast, and cereal.  Perfect for me to give me energy to do all the sightseeing by foot that I did.

It was a nice treat that he agreed to join me for beer at a neighborhood bar.  It's kind of a drag to go to a bar by myself, so this was extra special that he was with me.

Raul is a great communicator and has great style.  I will apply what I learned from him to how I interact with my guests in Cleveland. I had such a wonderful time I hope to see him again soon.",26

Also Nut, The Sphynx cat, deserves her own paragraph.  She has just as much personality as her owner, if not more! She was in heat during my stay so VERY affectionate, but just a lovely pet in general that is not shy and loves human company. :)

The house is spacious, with a typical Spanish flair; lots of light, vibrant colored walls, wooden furniture, plants, and a general rustic feel. Great place to relax and immerse yourself in a Mediterranean holiday vibe with some of Raul's Jazz music playing in the background.. Location is ideal, a 5 min walk from Chueca station, so right in the middle of the action!

Raul was always cordial but never intrusive. He shared everything: from his food, to his living space and his stories; usually with a glass of alcohol or two, or a Spanish snack on the side.

I didn't used the metro at all--was able to walk to everything I wanted to see--and enjoyed the neighborhood immensely. I can't recommend staying with Raul enough! ",71

244694485,92920,2018-03-19,167422108,Adrien,"I really enjoyed my stay at Raul's. I spent two night's at his apartment. It is located in an area that has a lot to offer in terms of various cuisines and nightlife options. Raul is also a very good resource if you need help planning a night out or deciding where you should have your tapas.

The apartment is very well decorated in my opinion and is kept clean and tidy. I am asthmatic and suffer from allergies as well but had no issues during my stay. Like he mentioned, Raul owns a cat but it is a Sphynx so you don't need to worry about fur being everywhere. Tip: Sphynxes still secrete the allergenic cat protein that makes your eyes itchy or red but you will be fine once you remember to wash your hands after playing with her. I played with the cat a few times and never had any issues. Both Raul and his cat were very respectful of my space and were only around when I wanted them to be.

The room that I stayed in is very spacious and well heated. Although I did not need to use it, I noticed that there was a portable A/C unit that could be used in warmer seasons. The bathroom is also spacious, heated and comfortable to use. The kitchen is also stocked with the basics (coffee, breads, eggs, milk etc). If you have any special preferences such as needing soy/almond milk instead of regular just let Raul know and he will help you out.

You might have also noticed that Raul offers free massages. I took him up on the offer an was not let down. He was very professional, respectful and best of all experienced. He is a certified therapeutic masseuse and has a special room that is equipped with a massage bed. In my case I really needed it because my muscles were ridiculously sore after spending the entire previous night out eating,drinking and dancing in Madrid. My recovery would have taken significantly longer if it were not for Raul's help.",17

Also, somebody in the flat smokes, although this is not an issue in the area where you stay as a guest. Having said all of this the apartment is cool, even in summer (despite no A/C) and the location is quite literally unbeatable. So central it's unbelievable. The bedroom also does not face onto the street so you don't have any traffic/square noise. An excellent room, with a few caveats.",85

There were a few things that happened which would be ok for a flexible person (which I am), but that I want to communicate to people who may expect more of a standard experience. 

When I arrived to the flat, Charo was at work, but because there were other guests at the house at the same time, I wasn't given a key set by her husband right away. I think it might have been a mix-up, however.

Also, Charo said she would give me an interior and less noisy room to stay in (I can't sleep well), but I was given an exterior room when I arrived (the other guests were in the other room). After talking to Charo about it, however, she was very accomodating and asked the other guests to switch rooms, which I greatly appreciated!

In the morning she sat with me to have breakfast and made me tea as we chatted about our lives. She's a very interesting woman. I recommend staying with Charo, especially for the indepenent traveller.

The location is also wonderful. We were able to get everywhere without any public transportation. The flat was also great because we felt as though we had a lot of privacy the whole time. Charo was very helpful before and during our trip. Before we got there, we received e-mails about the history of Madrid and she pointed us in the direction of the most beautiful buildings and areas Madrid had to offer.

The flat is a very central one, and although it's in a very busy area, you don't hear anything from your room! The place of the room is also ideal because it's somehow separated from the rest of the house but next to the bathroom and the kitchen.

The flat is very central so you should think about saving the metro-ticket because walking to all the famous sites is indeed possible! The neighbourhood is quite lively and in the evening buzzing of activity. But dont worry, your room is going out to the back to a small courtyard, so the street noise wont disturb you. The room is quite big and the bed very comfortable. I enjoyed my stay and would gladly come again, speaking very little spanish was no problem either. If you go there, make sure to check out the small italian take-away at the corner to the left... awesome pizza and pasta for very reasonable prices!

Oh, one small downside: There is no internet available at the flat. But there are many small cafes around the place with free wifi, so not a big problem really.",21

Although it was listed in the email that I would be booking 2 people- we were asked to pay small extra fee before departing.  That being said we spent such little time at the actual apartment during our very short stay that Charo said next time we stay - if ever- she would give us a generous discount.

There was some construction work going on, but that didn't bother me and it will be finished end aug 2011. Charo also asked what I wanted for breakfast and put it on the kitchen table each morning.

We went to Cordoba, Cadiz, Granada and ended our trip in Madrid. Since the first response I received from Charo I knew her home will be the right place for us to stay. She sent me plenty of information about the city and what to see in our short 3 night stay. Her apartment is about 10 minutes walk from Gran Via. We took the metro when we arrived at the train station and also we took the metro to go to the airport. Charo gave us very clear directions. Charo and her husband Conrad welcomed us as part of their family. We felt right at home. The room is very comfortable and has an interior window, this feature is nice because the room is quiet and we were able to sleep in a little. Coffee always ready in the morning, even the morning we were leaving and we had to wake up at 5am. Charo was there to say goodbye. We started a friendship that I'm sure will last for years. We are looking forward to visit Madrid again, and of course we will book with Charo.

The location is superb....a quiet side street downtown just a block or two from the metro, tapas, cafes, historic sites, and shopping.  Charo was friendly, helpful, and always available for questions.  My room and bath were very clean and private.  There was fresh hot coffee put out for me each morning.

I was there just 1 night because I was doing a quick trip from Dallas to Madrid to earn double miles on my airline, but I will remember this trip fondly. Charo and Conrad are excellent hosts - Charo generously shared her knowledge of Madrid and introduced me to ""porras"" with cafe con leche at breakfast - she even got up early on Sunday to get them. It's like being part of a family in Spain.
The location is excellent, a little north of Puerta del Sol. I hope to get a chance to return soon!",70

931454,93100,2012-02-19,1727213,Julia,"I was only a day in Charo house. Talk about the situation of the House does not make sense, because looking at the map one can see who is in the heart of Madrid. With regard to the building and the House I can only say that from the first time you get into a world full of history, culture and art. And when it comes to the host, I have to say that it is one of those people that gives you everything. Connect with you immediately and in five minutes makes you feel that you are at home. He is a cultured, intelligent and with an empathy out of the ordinary person. But if you are lucky to meet Astor, then I tell you that you are not going to have time or desire to go out on the streets. That boy, he has an imagination, a smile and so rare dialectical capacity, which, when you talk to him, you get to forget about time and space. Therefore, when you return to Madrid, not I hesitate returning home Charo. I loved it and I recommend it to everyone.

Estuve sÃ³lo un dÃ­a en casa de Charo. Hablar de la situaciÃ³n de la casa no tiene sentido, pues mirando el mapa cualquiera puede ver que estÃ¡ en el corazÃ³n de Madrid. Respecto del edificio y la casa sÃ³lo puedo decir que desde el primer momento te sumerges en un mundo lleno de historia, de cultura y de arte. Y por lo que toca a la anfitriona, tengo que decir que es una de esas personas que lo da todo. Conecta contigo enseguida y a los cinco minutos te hace sentir que estÃ¡s en tu casa. Es una persona culta, inteligente y con una empatÃ­a fuera de lo normal. Pero si tenÃ©is la suerte de conocer a Astor, entonces os digo que no vais a tener tiempo ni ganas de salir a la calle Ese chico, tiene una imaginaciÃ³n, una sonrisa y una capacidad dialÃ©ctica tan poco comÃºn, que, cuando hablas con Ã©l, llegas a olvidarte del tiempo y del espacio.  Por todo ello, cuando vuelva a Madrid, no dudarÃ© en volver a casa de Charo. Me encantÃ³ y se lo recomiendo a todo el mundo. ",27

Very eager to help you when it comes to organizing your stay in Madrid, giving tips which things are worth seeing and where to go. She was most helpful when my flight was rescheduled and I had to catch the airport bus at 4 'o clock a.m. by driving me to the right bus station! So this should tell you enough about how helpful she ist. Her home is a spacious flat in central Madrid, very nicely decorated with art pieces from her own gallery.

The neighborhood is very safe and easy to navigate, with a vibrant atmosphere, but it seems that most of Madrid is quite lively. La Gran Via is only a few streets away, and I enjoyed my daily routine. They gave me helpful guides/maps, as well.
Thank you, Charo y Conrad!

Charo, Conrad and their son chatted with us and shared refreshments with us when we arrived, providing tips on museums and sights to see.  We did not see Charo much after that because her mother was ill and needed her attention.  So we were largely on our own after that.  Two concerns.  First we did not think to ask whether this was a non-smoking site (which we normally insist on) and it wasn't.  Second, there was no hot water in our bathroom the second and third days and no one to talk to about it. ",88

She told us about a Moroccan restaurant that was outstanding.  She also gave us other tips on places to eat.  The flat is ideally situated.

The guestroom is large, with an anteroom, so there is lots of room to organize your things and get comfortable, plus a large private bathroom with bath and shower. Due to the layout of the apartment, it is like having your own wing.  The whole apartment is very clean. 

Charo could not have been more helpful in providing information about Madrid, where she has lived her whole life, really caring about making sure we made the most of our stay. It was great staying with this lovely family, getting to meet the 11 year old son, who speaks good English, and being made to feel so at home. 

It's impossible to imagine a better place to stay. We could not recommend it more highly.

An earlier review mentioned that the husband in the couple smokes. The only way a guest would even smell tobacco is if they spend time in the living room. Guests can enter and leave the apartment and go directly through a hallway to the guestroom, without ever entering the living room. Although we were welcomed to use the living room, which has large windows and a balcony. Whenever we were in the living room, he either went out to the balcony to smoke, or asked if we minded.  ",91

Her family, Conrad and Astor are also equally delightful. I enjoyed your company too. My room was very large with everything I needed, it was nice and cool on a hot day. The apartment is so close to everything so you are able to walk everywhere (I almost wore out my shoes!). Gran Via is such an interesting suburb, something always going on. Great shops and good food too.",4

I think it's geometrically impossible. We never took a bus anywhere since it was all in walking distance. Her house is built to allow air to flow through the rooms so it was never hot even in the 90+ degree weather.

Furthermore, Charo is such an wonderful host. She gives you a map and points out where to go. She treats you well and is very helpful. Se took us to the airport for 30 Euro which was perfect.

Don't look elsewhere to stay. This is THE place to stay in Madrid. The only bad thing was not booking more time.",84

The room was spacious, clean, very quiet and airy.  The mattress was very comfortable, and I loved the Ikea pillows.  The private bathroom was very functional and had a great shower.  But the best of all was Charo and her family.  Astor and Conrad were very helpful and friendly. I can't thank them enough.  Charo was very prompt at giving tips, was a lot of fun to be around and even introduced me to the traditional San Fermin, running of the bulls in Pamplona, which I had the pleasure to watch every morning with her.  I shall be back in Madrid in September and plan on spending a couple of days at Room Central Madrid. I recommend it without reservations.  Thank you Charo and the boys!

Every morning before she left for work she had fresh coffee made in the kitchen for us as well as juice and treats. Her son is also a great host! In the morning he would ask us how we slept. He is a great kid, smart and funny.  Together they were very helpful in showing us all the points of interest in Madrid. Charo and her son told us about restaurants, parks etc... We all had many great conversations and we will miss that part of the family feeling. Their apartment is clean and their location was perfect. They are close to the subway line, Plaza del Sol, The Gran Via etc...
I would go back to Madrid just to stay with them again!!!",32

She gave us great tips on where to visit and dine. On our last day we had a long chat in the morning talking about Madrid's history, even she can't speak English very well and we can't even speak a word of Spanish... It was a great conversation and she even send us to the train station which was nearby. As we part tears filled our eyes and it's time to go. We had a great time, thanks again Charo ",71

And still as the room is away from the street you are never bothered by the noise when you go to sleep; and big plus: you have your own bathroom.
Charo keeps the place very clean and always ready to help you out.

Lots of places to have a drink, lunch and diner. Our favorite restaurant down the street is Casa Fadrique. Perfect place to have home made food with great ambiance. If you want to feel local, this is the place. Juanjo and his mother Cecila will make you feel special.
Charo is a great host. She will give you lots of info on Madrid. Her apartment is comfortable and clean. The room is large that also has another den for you to enjoy some privacy and your computer. You have your own bathroom, which is large enough with two sinks. 
Charo will leave a light breakfast ready in the morning for when you wake up. 
Overall, Charo is a great lady who appreciates the art and candid conversations.

The room is on the other end of the house from where she and her family lives, so there is some privacy. The room was well kept and clean. For those sensitive to the smell of cigarette smoke (like myself), it would be good to know that the entrance to the apartment smells very strongly of cigarette smoke. The bedroom and bathroom actually did not smell of smoke at all though, so it was ok in the end! Thanks, Charo.",48

We could visit Palacio Real in the morning then came back home to have a spanish siesta, but still had enough time to visit museo del Prado in the afternoon. Every time we moved on foot.
You can even find many affordable bars around this area.
We stayed just 1 night and it's a pity that we had to go sleep even though Charo suggested having wine together in the night because we were too tired after 13 hours flight and all day sightseeing.",45

Our room was perfect (quiet and comfortable), the Metro was a quick 5 minute walk, only 10 minutes to Puerto de Sol.  Her neighborhood is one of the most diverse and interesting ones in all of Madrid.  Every need could be met within only a few minutes walk.

We love their Malasana neighborhood and the  Tribunal metro stop is just around the corner.  Their flat is large and on the 2nd floor.  They have an elevator which was great when we were carrying our bags.  The room we stayed in is at the back of the flat near the kitchen.  We were not prepared for how noisy the streets were at night and were glad to be in the back where it is very quiet.  The room was clean and comfortable.  The bathroom is just outside the room in the hallway and was very clean and roomy. Charo left great coffee for us in the morning.   We spent some fun times with Charo and her family and I think that our friendship will continue through e-mails and (Hidden by Airbnb) .  We had no complaints.   When we visited the temperatures were perfect and we were comfortable in our room.  We had a great time!  Thank-you Charo!,33

Also the flexibility to drop the lugage already in the morning on the day of arrival and to leave the luggage till departure in the evening was very kind.
The breakfast was basic and contained a local speciality. Good enough to start your day!
The location is also very nice and allows you to explore most highlights easily by foot or metro.

She has limited English, but was very patient with my even more limited Spanish! She is very knowledgeable about the city, and was able to direct me to the perfect place to purchase the authentic Spanish fan I had been seeking (Casa Diego). Her apartment is in a lively neighborhood close to museums and shopping, but the room faces onto a quiet courtyard, so no problems with noise. It was very hot in Madrid during my stay; but while there is no air-conditioning, the room stayed cool with the help of an electric fan. The room is very spacious as described and the bathroom next door was for my use alone. Ample hot water and pressure made for my first decent shower since arriving in Spain the month before. I took Charo up on her offer to drive me to the airport for 30 Euros (the fixed price in Madrid that a taxi charges for an airport ride). She got up at 6 am to drive me, and at that hour the trip took less than half an hour. I got to the airport 2 hours before my flight was scheduled to depart; but it took over an hour to check in and I made it through security just in time to board. Based on this experience, I would suggest that Charo tell furure guests to plan on arriving at least 3 hours before an international flight out of Madrid. ",79

There was an bad odor comming from the part of the house where host leave. You get what you pay for it.

However, there are 2 small matters which I am writing here so that Charo will make improvement- 1) both the bath towels had a musty smell- probably not dried enough 2) being Asians n frequent travellers, we prefer to sleep with the room lights on due to unfamiliar surroundings esp when the room has no door lock- this action of ours has resulted a sarcastic comment from a guy who stays there - he asked us "" is electricity free in your country? Ours is very expensive"" - well,  I feel this comment is really uncalled for- he could hv said it in a more courteous way esp it is so early in the morning too.",55

Arrivati al secondo piano del palazzo lei ci aspettava al suo ingresso... Le ho fatto presente il fatto che non sapessimo quale fosse il suo appartamento e se non ho capito male mi ha risposto che era scritto nella conferma... io ho ricontrollato ma non c'era nulla di scritto che facesse riferimento a questa cosa.

But  you're close enough to everything that I never walked more than 20mins to get to a destination! Charo is so kind a generous and took the time to pick me up from the airport and helped me with washing.

Tolle Gegend, abends ist auf den StraÃen viel los (""Soho"" von Madrid). Nachts und morgens war es im Haus und in der Wohnung aber angenehm ruhig. Wir waren zu zweit und hatten zwei ineinanderÃ¼bergehende RÃ¤ume mit einem Doppelbett und einem Etagenbett. Da die Zimmer auf einen breiten Lichtschacht hinausgehen, sind sie sehr dunkel. Im heiÃen Sommer stÃ¶rt das aber wenig. Alles sehr einfach und sauber. Bad und KÃ¼che gleich nebenan. Charo hat uns zur angekÃ¼ndigten Zeit in der Wohnung sehr freundlich empfangen, uns Zimmer und KÃ¼che/Bad gezeigt, die SchlÃ¼ssel Ã¼berreicht und mit Tipps fÃ¼r Madrid versorgt. FÃ¼rs FrÃ¼hstÃ¼ck hat Charo uns Kaffee, Milch, Saft, FrÃ¼hstÃ¼cksbrot, Joghurt und Melone bereit gestellt. Mikrowelle und KÃ¼hlschrank sind vorhanden.

The professionally prepared photos in the listing created some let-down - only seating was 2 wooden chairs plus small table, no sight of any lounges, the window looks into a light-well with view of opposite blanked  windows, etc.
Appreciate Charo's effort to get up at 5.30 am for our transport to the airport. ",38
43026166,93100,2015-08-17,29213923,Hannah,"Let's start with the slightly negative stuff:

Upon our arrival, I called Charo who then buzzed us in and told us to come up to the second floor. There my brother and I were left wondering whether we actually were in the right place, as nobody opened either of the two doors on the floor. Instead, for a good 5 minutes we had to stand there and listen to a man and a woman shouting at each other in one of the flats while their dog was barking really loudly. Finally, I called Charo again. She and her husband turned out to be the fighting couple.

We didn't get any recommendations from her, and the breakfast she provided us with were tiny buns wrapped in plastic, some stale biscuits and toast.

The doors in the flat are quite creaky, so the first time I tried to shut it, it made a bit of noise. I am a very careful person who doesn't use excessive force, so it really wasn't all that loud. Charo's husband then told me in a very aggravated manner not to slam the door, which I didn't. We apologised anyway and didn't really think about the incident anymore. But a few hours later, I got a message on AIRBNB from Charo, saying that 'they would not indulge such behaviour' and if we 'came to their house to make our stay more economical than a hotel, the least they ask is education'. We felt very attacked, especially since we'd apologised beforehand.

On quite a few photos that have now been removed, a spacious living room was to be seen. We were led to believe that this room was accessible to the guests, which it wasn't.

But we stayed at the apartment for 4 days, and for the rest of our holiday, Charo's husband was nothing but nice. We didn't get to see much of Charo herself.

The flat is easy to find, there is a supermarket in the same street, and you really can explore Madrid on foot if you stay there.

Overall, our stay was very nice.

Cependant, vu que Charo n'est pas toujours prÃ©sente, son ami Mauro prend la relÃ¨ve.  Mauro est dÃ©sagrÃ©able et nous fait comprendre qu'il n'est pas la personne Ã  qui poser les questions sur Madrid, que l'endroit louÃ© n'est pas un gÃ®te touristique. nous chicane si nous fermons la porte de chambre avec bruit et c'est difficile de ne pas en faire (il faudrait alors qu'il change les vieilles poignÃ©es). On sent une impatience pour l'ouverture de la porte de sortie (c'est difficile les premiÃ¨res fois - ce n'est pas Ã©vident) Un matin. il a engueulÃ© nos voisines de chambre australiennes dans la cuisine adjacente Ã  notre chambre et a fermÃ© le courant pour 2 minutes environ et a remis.  Nous sommes des personnes qui respectent les consignes Ã©crites par Charo, mais lÃ  c'Ã©tait trop.  Une chance que ce n'Ã©tait que pour 2 nuits car nous serions  partis si j'avais louÃ© pour une semaine.  
Il faut comprendre qu'au QuÃ©bec, les B&B sont des gites touristiques mais avec un cÃ´tÃ© plus familial et c'est une formule que nous aimons.  Ce n'Ã©tait vraiment pas le cas.  
La chambre Ã©tait bien et lit confortable.  L'endroit est bien situÃ© pour visiter les attraits touristiques de Madrid.   Cependant, je n'opterai plus jamais pour cette formule en Europe.

49309313,93100,2015-10-03,9518827,Susie,"Let me start by saying that this was most definitely the worst experience I have had since traveling with air bnb. First of all, her residence was very difficult to find. Finally, after finding the building, she never even came downstairs to let us know where to go. After entering the residence, we were taken to a dirty, dusty room which was not appealing at all. Next, the man that she is residing with is absolutely crazy. He's extremely argumentative and aggressive.  We were speaking to Charro in English and he started raising his voice and telling us to speak in Spanish since we were in Spain. We went out to get a bite to eat and when we came back he came to our room yelling at us and forcing the house rules in our faces, and telling us that we slammed the door, even though we hadn't. He became very aggressive and started moving towards me and into my personal space and I held my hand out and told him to step back. I felt like I was a child being scolded by her parent, and honestly I felt like he has the capability of 'snapping' at any given moment. He then started yelling at my friend to speak Spanish even though she kept telling him that she didn't speak Spanish. He kept saying ""I know you speak Spanish, I heard you"". We were looking to find another place to stay, but it was too late and our wifi wasn't working. From then on, we decided to stay out most of the day in order to avoid him. We were so uncomfortable that it almost ruined our trip. We were paranoid to make any noise at all. Even on our last night, Charro was not helpful at all, and avoided even being around us. We didn't feel welcome from the first moment to the last.  I would not recommend this bnb to anyone. If you do choose this bnb, beware and make sure you speak Spanish and be able to recite their house rules. Susie/Helen.",48

No me gustÃ³ mucho la actitud del sujeto que vive ahi.

No nos insultÃ³, ni dijo nada malo, pero su actitud demostraba que estaba molesto. Lo cual me pareciÃ³ raro, pues no creo que hayamos hecho nada malo.

You will hear a little bit of noise from neighbors through the window and from the water pipes, but nothing unbearable.  This specific room did not have a lock either, which was concerning at first.

There is a list of rules in the bedroom to keep you right and surveillance cameras in the corridors which I presume is a safety measure for Charo?

When we arrived, they were doing constructions in the corridor next to our room, we even heard the husband screaming insults in Spanish... We didnât felt welcome, I would say that it is more like a business to them and that they didnât care about us at all. Probably they are bored of doing it.. 
One night we crossed path with a cockroache in the bathroom... Another thing, you have to know that you will share the apartment with other travelers from Airbnb but you CANâT close your room with a key...!! There is motion sensing camera everywhere... Weird atmospher. If you want to have fun at the place you stay, put music and laugh with your friends at any time, this isnât the right place to stay!  The two good points about the flat was the free âcroissantâ and coffee in the kitchen and the fact that the apartment is really well located, just in the center. When we left the apartment with a little late (20mins), the only thing Charo asked us when we called her on the phone to ask her where to put the key was: âwhy are you still there?â Really upset, she didnât asked how we found the stay or anything else then hang up the phone.   We are 3 really polite, well educated and friendly girls from Paris and we donât recommend it !",3

PROS: location â MalasaÃ±a was nice and in the art district. One site listed it as one of the trendiest neighborhoods to live in. a square down the street, Plaza Mayor is in 12 min walking distance and not far are other sites to include the Royale Palace of Madrid).

CONS: I canât think of one, but if I had to post one it would be waiting on the other guest to finish up with shower â and thatâs stretching it. I could have paid for a private room or loft with and shower for an additional fee elsewhere, but did not feel that was needed.

Charo greeted us when my wife and I arrived and explained the house rules in Spanish as her English was not the best, but I spoke and understood the language so there were no problems in that area.  There are french doors that open to a closed in space, so it gets a breeze but no street noises so my wife and I had quiet nights to sleep â and a TV to see the local news and weather. The host had coffee, espresso, juice, water, candy, and other minor amenities in the commons/kitchen that were nice to have while we were getting ready in the morning â other AirBnb did not, but no complaints. The host lived elsewhere and we shared the loft with a two students that were studying there, but never saw them. Bottom line â my wife and I were out most of the time seeing the sites of Madrid and did not spend much of it in the AirBnb, but It made our stay in Spain that more enjoyable as it was a lovely, quiet place to stay and sleep.",79

Two things Iâd recommend: Please install a lock on the bedroom door. Although I was the only one staying, it could be a problem even though thereâs a camera installed in the hallway. Secondly, putting some hanging space in the bathroom would improve the experience since it was odd to go to the bedroom wrapped in towel considering thereâs camera in the hallway.

She also provides you with breakfast foods and answers all of your questions (she will even help you plan your day).  On top of all of that, she gave my cousin and I free tickets to a wonder Flamenco show on our first night in Madrid and drove us to Atocha (the main station) one morning when she was heading in that direction.  She lives outside of the main city center, but it is peaceful and safe where she lives.  You can reach the city center quickly by the Renfe train, but if you stay out late like we did a few nights, the N11 bus will take you from Banco de Espana to her apartment.  The room was perfect and you get your own bathroom.  Definitely recommend staying here!!",41

She gave us lots of advice on sites, attractions and places to eat while in Madrid. While it is necessary to use public transport to travel in/out of the city centre, this is really easy. Malinka has written instructions on what tranport and lines to catch for travel day and night. Breakfast was nice and had a huge variety for us to choose from - cereals, breads, meats, cheeses, spreads, eggs, yoghurt, coffee and juice. Malinka was also completely flexible with timing so we could sleep in without worrying about missing breakfast! Our private space in the apartment was small but absolutely adequate for our needs.",5

Explained to us the Metro and transport systems and assisted us with buying tickets on the drive back to her apartment.  She was extra accommodating with our booking dates and also gave us free tickets to the flamenco. Breakfast was ready for us whoever we wanted, some morningd we were up at 8.30am and others at 10am, neither was a problem. We would certainly stay again when we are in Madrid.

The room was big and had great curtains to block the early morning sun out for a great sleep in. The beds were very comfortable. We had our own bathroom, the shower was small but did the job.

Malinka is a walking book of knowledge and is very helpful with places of interest, where to go, what to see, etc. the 2 rooms had confortable beds. 
One negative thing I want to mention has to with kids at a small age playing outside below our apartment, and sometimes yelling while our window was open. The parents are out with them till after 12 
o'clock. They don't really seem to care people are trying to rest or sleep. That was annoying.",93

Malinka is very friendly and helpful.  As her apartment is not in the centre of Madrid you need to catch the train into the main station to access outside towns and the centre of Madrid.  I found the area a little scary at night. 
The apartment had all you would need including a washing machine.  Good value for the money.",59
