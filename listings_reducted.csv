We welcome you to Spain and we wish you a good stay in Madrid!

Oscar works as a photographer and Vanessa is an actress and theatre producer (during 2017 I became mum, so I won't be doing check in's for a while). However, until some years ago Oscar was an engineer and Vanessa was a M&A lawyer. And then one day we decided to turn our lifes up side down and follow our real passions.

We are best friends and on May 2012 we decided to move forward and enroll in a small business together. Vanessa had been hosting with Airbnb for 2 years by then (renting the spare room at her place in Madrid/Milan and her apartment in Barcelona) and her experience (upgraded to Superhost in early 2011) was so positive that we decided we could also help other owners that don't live in town or don't have the time to rent their properties to travelers as you. And this is what we are doing now together. 

More about us, we love to travel: Vanessa has travelled 4 out of the 5 continents with a backpack that has been with her for 18 years now and now has enrolled in her new adventure: becoming a mum in spring 2017. Conversely, Oscar travels by bike and closer to Madrid, so as often as he can he takes his bike for a short trip in the mountains (he's really fit!). He has also spent several summers working in France. As the business grew, we took more people on board. Firstly Paula, a Venezuelan that has been living in Madrid for 11 years now, also keen on travels and on exploring new places. Paula is full of energy and we love her smiley caracter. And last but not least, Javi, whom you'll see on weekends and public holidays (and more often now that the Vanessa's baby is here!).

We are also keen in meeting new people and learning new things from them, but more importantly, we want you to feel at home at any of our apartments and that you feel that there's someone in town who cares for you:-)

We welcome you to Spain and we wish you a good stay in Madrid!

Oscar works as a photographer and Vanessa is an actress and theatre producer (during 2017 I became mum, so I won't be doing check in's for a while). However, until some years ago Oscar was an engineer and Vanessa was a M&A lawyer. And then one day we decided to turn our lifes up side down and follow our real passions.

We are best friends and on May 2012 we decided to move forward and enroll in a small business together. Vanessa had been hosting with Airbnb for 2 years by then (renting the spare room at her place in Madrid/Milan and her apartment in Barcelona) and her experience (upgraded to Superhost in early 2011) was so positive that we decided we could also help other owners that don't live in town or don't have the time to rent their properties to travelers as you. And this is what we are doing now together. 

More about us, we love to travel: Vanessa has travelled 4 out of the 5 continents with a backpack that has been with her for 18 years now and now has enrolled in her new adventure: becoming a mum in spring 2017. Conversely, Oscar travels by bike and closer to Madrid, so as often as he can he takes his bike for a short trip in the mountains (he's really fit!). He has also spent several summers working in France. As the business grew, we took more people on board. Firstly Paula, a Venezuelan that has been living in Madrid for 11 years now, also keen on travels and on exploring new places. Paula is full of energy and we love her smiley caracter. And last but not least, Javi, whom you'll see on weekends and public holidays (and more often now that the Vanessa's baby is here!).

We are also keen in meeting new people and learning new things from them, but more importantly, we want you to feel at home at any of our apartments and that you feel that there's someone in town who cares for you:-) 

We enjoy little life pleasures like riding our bicycles or growing our small organic vegetables gardens. We like eco-friendly environments since we care a lot about our planet. 

We will help you to find you like home in this beautiful city and we look forward to having the opportunity to meet you soon!!

Vivimos durante varios años en la Plaza Mayor y allí estábamos felices, con un montón de planes a nuestro alrededor, con la tranquilidad de cualquier hogar de puertas para adentro y el bullicio de Madrid con sólo abrir los balcones.

Nuestra familia fue creciendo y tuvimos que cambiarnos de casa, pero como teníamos mucho cariño a nuestro apartamento, decidimos compartirlo con otros viajeros que quisieran conocer el encanto de Madrid.
 
¡Desde los balcones del apartamento se podía disfrutar de una de las plazas con más vida del mundo! Era 2013 y nacía Plaza Mayor Deluxe.

Todo al principio fue una aventura, la reforma, imaginar cómo decorábamos el apartamento, qué equipamiento dejábamos dentro, electrodomésticos, cómo contactábamos con la gente que quisiera alquilarlo…Lo que sí teníamos muy claro es que nuestro fin último es que los invitados que se alojaran en nuestro apartamento se sintieran como en casa.

Entonces llegó nuestra primera reserva... y luego otra y otra más… la gente no sólo venía una vez, sino que ¡muchos querían volver!
Fue cuando nos encontramos con un problema, ¡no teníamos días libres! (vaya problema, ¿verdad?). No en serio, nos daba mucha rabia que la gente que íbamos conociendo y que se iban convirtiendo en amigos quisieran venir a Madrid y no tuviéramos un lugar para ellos. Así que nos liamos la manta a la cabeza y empezamos a trabajar con más apartamentos. En el 2015 nacía Romantic, también en la Plaza Mayor, ideal para parejas. Este apartamento tiene ventanales dan a un patio interior con lo cual se puede disfrutar de los planes de la Plaza Mayor y la tranquilidad y el silencio de un patio privado. 

En el 2016 se nos presentó la oportunidad de gestionar dos apartamentos más y allá que nos lanzamos! Uno de ellos está también en la Plaza Mayor, es el apartamento de más capacidad (hasta 5 personas), lo llamamos Family. El otro está muy cerca de Plaza de España y desde sus ventanales se ve completamente el Palacio Real, las vistas de día y de noche cuando se ilumina el Palacio son espectaculares. Sencillamente impresionante!

El último, por el momento, es Elegance y lo inauguramos en Marzo de 2017. Es un apartamento espectacular, tiene dos habitaciones y en la habitación principal hay dos balcones desde los que se ve la Plaza Mayor, un salón gigante y un cuarto de baño enorme con ducha y bañera. ¡Todo lujo y elegancia!

Lo mejor sin duda de estos años ha sido la cantidad de gente estupenda que hemos ido conociendo, con ellos hemos ido creciendo y ahora tenemos amigos por todo el mundo! 

Os invitamos a que disfrutéis de nuestros apartamentos y esperamos que os sintáis como en vuestra casa.

Madrileña de nacimiento. Vivo y trabajo en Madrid aunque he viajado por países de Europa, Centro y Sur América y Norte de África. Mi destino pendiente: Asia. Hablo Español, Portugués y me defiendo con el Inglés.

Estudié Educación Social y comencé Antropología Cultural. Viví durante un tiempo en Brasil, dónde estudié parte de esta apasionante carrera, la cuál de momento, no he llegado a terminar.
Me dedico a la intervención social con personas sin hogar, en alojamientos institucionales. Un trabajo que considero interesante y desde el que creo se aprende mucho; Sobre todo a nivel de respeto y convivencia, del trato entre personas desde el lado más humano y cómo resolver problemas desde la creatividad y el ingenio.

Intento meditar, procuro pintar y hacer manualidades y me gusta mucho bailar. He hecho danza oriental durante años, aunque ahora la tengo un poco abandonada. También he sacado mi lado más artístico a flote haciendo cursos de clown y poniendo en escena a algún personaje.

Me gusta mucho cocinar. Para mí y para los demás. He hecho cursos profesionales y disfruto enseñando la preparación de platos típicos de nuestra región, aunque me gusta elaborar recetas de cualquier parte del mundo (por lo menos las que conozco).

En mis ratos libres disfruto dando un paseo, visitando los mercados y parques del barrio en el que vivo o teniendo una buena conversación mientras se toma una cerveza con una buena tapa o un chocolate con churros. Esos pequeños-grandes placeres de la vida, de los cuáles creo que se puede gozar en Madrid, sin gastar mucho y si lo conoces un poco. Dar un paseo por el Rastro de Madrid, ir a un concierto o ir al teatro.
Creo que soy de esas personas que te pueden enseñar el Madrid que no sale en las guías turísticas, así como informarte de los lugares más emblemáticos y las rutas típicas. 
Además, cerca de casa, el intercambiador de Plaza Elíptica o la Estación de Atocha te puede llevar a lugares también muy especiales y cercanos como Toledo, Alcalá de Henares o zonas más al Norte como la Sierra de Madrid.
Lugares que me encanta visitar o por los que salir a dar una caminata, sobre todo por el campo, donde procuro ir de vez en cuando. Me gusta mucho hacer escapadas a la naturaleza o pasar unos días en el pequeño pueblo de mi madre, en Ávila.

El barrio en el que vivo y trabajo, Carabanchel, me resulta muy agradable. Tiene una vida social y comunitaria interesante. Sin moverme de él puedo salir a hacer unas compras o dar cursos en los centros públicos o alternativos que existen en la zona.

Madrid, Maguerit como la denominaron los árabes, es una ciudad con mucha magia y encanto, de la que se puede gozar, sobre todo con unas pequeñas pistas y ganas de pasarlo bien.
Te espero en mi casa, de la que disfrutarás durante tu estancia.


Hi, I'm Monica!

Madrid's birth. I live and work in Madrid although I have toured countries of Europe, Central and South America and North Africa. My pending destination: Asia. I speak Spanish, Portuguese and defend me with English.

Studied Social education and Cultural Anthropology began. I lived for a time in Brazil, where studied part of this exciting race, which for the time being, I have not come to end.

I am the social intervention with homeless people, in institutional accommodations. A work which I consider interesting and from which I believe can learn a lot; Above all at the level of respect and coexistence, the treatment of people from the more human side and how solve problems from the creativity and ingenuity.

I try to meditate, try to paint and do crafts and I love dancing. I've done Oriental Dance for years, but now I have it a little abandoned. I've also taken my side more artistic afloat doing clown courses and putting in scene a character.

I really like cooking. For me and for others. I've done professional courses and enjoy teaching the preparation of typical dishes from our region, although I like to prepare recipes from anywhere in the world (at least that I know).

In my spare time I enjoy walking, visiting markets and parks of the neighborhood in which I live or having a good conversation while sipping a beer with a good top or a chocolate with ""churros"". Those ""little and big pleasures of life"", which I think that you can enjoy in Madrid, without spending much and if you know him a bit. Take a stroll through the Rastro de Madrid, go to a concert or go to the theatre.

Think I'm of those people who can teach you the Madrid which does not appear in tourist guides as well as inform you of the most emblematic places and typical routes.

In addition, close to home, the Plaza elíptica exchanger or Atocha station can take you to places nearby such as Toledo, Alcalá de Henares and areas further north as the Sierra de Madrid and also very special.
Places that I love to visit or why go to hike, especially for the field, where I try to go from time to time. I like to much make getaways to nature or spend a few days in the small village of my mother, in Avila.

District in which I live and work, Carabanchel, is very pleasant for me. It has an interesting social and community life. Without leaving him I go out to do some shopping or take courses in public or alternative centers that exist in the area.

Madrid, Maguerit as they called it the Arabs, is a city with much magic and charm, which you can enjoy, especially with some small tracks and desire to pass it well.

I hope in my house, which you can enjoy during your stay.

    Além disso, perto de casa, o permutador de Plaza elíptica ou estação Atocha pode te levar a lugares próximos como Toledo, Alcalá de Henares e áreas mais a norte, como o Sierra de Madrid e também muito especial.

    Lugares que adoro visitar ou por que vai para caminhar, especialmente para o campo, onde eu tento ir de vez em quando. Eu queria muito fazer viagens à natureza ou passar alguns dias na pequena aldeia de minha mãe, em Ávila.

No distrito em que vivo e trabalho, Carabanchel, é muito agradável para mim. Tem uma vida interessante, social e comunitário. Sem deixá-lo, saio para fazer compras ou fazer cursos em centros públicos ou alternativos que existem na área.

     

    Madrid, Maguerit como lhe chamavam os árabes, é uma cidade com muita magia e encanto, que você pode desfrutar, especialmente com algumas pequenas faixas e desejo passá-la bem.

    Espero em minha casa, que poderá desfrutar durante a sua estadia.

    Salut, je suis Monica.

Naissance de Madrid. J'habite et travaille à Madrid, bien que j'ai fait une tournée des pays d'Europe, centrale et l'Amérique du Sud et Afrique du Nord. Ma destination en attente : Asie. Je parle espagnol, portugais et me défendre avec l'anglais.

     

    Éducation sociale étudie et anthropologie culturelle a commencé. J'ai vécu pendant un certain temps au Brésil, où une partie étudiée de ce passionnant course, qui pour l'instant, je ne suis pas venu à la fin.

    Je suis l'intervention sociale auprès des sans-abri, dans accommodements institutionnels. Un travail qui me paraît intéressant et qui je crois peut apprendre beaucoup de choses ; Surtout au niveau du respect et de coexistence, le traitement de personnes côté plus humain et comment résoudre les problèmes de la créativité et l'ingéniosité.

     

    j'ai essayer de méditer, essayer de peindre et de métiers d'art et j'aime danser. J'ai fait danse est pour des années, mais maintenant je l'ai un peu abandonné. J'ai aussi pris mon côté plus artistique sous voile, faire des cours de clown et mettant en scène un personnage.

     

    J'aime vraiment cuisiner. Pour moi et pour d'autres. J'ai fait des cours de formation professionnelles et profiter de l'enseignement de la préparation de plats typiques de notre région, bien que j'aime préparer des recettes de partout dans le monde (au moins que je connais).

     

    Dans mon temps libre, j'aime marcher, visiter les marchés et les parcs du quartier dans lequel j'habite ou avoir une bonne conversation en sirotant une bière avec un bon top ou un chocolat avec des churros. Ces pequenos-grandes plaisirs de la vie, qui, je pense que vous pouvez apprécier à Madrid, sans dépenser beaucoup et si tu le connais un peu. Promenez-vous dans le Rastro de Madrid, aller à un concert ou aller au théâtre.

    Pense que je suis de ceux qui peut vous apprendre le Madrid qui n'apparaît pas dans la touristique guide ainsi que vous informe des lieux emblématiques et des itinéraires typiques.

    En outre, à proximité de la maison, l'échangeur de Plaza elíptica ou la gare d'Atocha peut vous emmener dans des endroits à proximité comme Tolède, Alcalá de Henares et zones plus au nord de la Sierra de Madrid et aussi très spécial.

    Les lieux que j'aime visiter ou pourquoi aller faire de la randonnée, en particulier pour le champ, où j'essaie d'aller de temps en temps. J'aime beaucoup escapades de rendre à la nature ou passer quelques jours dans le petit village de ma mère, à Avila.

     

    District dans lequel je vis et travaille, Carabanchel, est très agréable pour moi. Il a une vie sociale et communautaire intéressante. Sans lui laisser, je sors pour faire du shopping ou prendre des cours dans des centres publics ou alternatives qui existent dans la région.

     

    Madrid, Maguerit comme ils l'appelaient les arabes, est une ville avec beaucoup de magie et charme, que vous pouvez profiter, en particulier avec d'autres petits titres et désirez passer bien.

    J'espère que dans ma maison, que vous pourrez déguster lors de votre séjour.

We welcome you to Spain and we wish you a good stay in Madrid!

Oscar works as a photographer and Vanessa is an actress and theatre producer (during 2017 I became mum, so I won't be doing check in's for a while). However, until some years ago Oscar was an engineer and Vanessa was a M&A lawyer. And then one day we decided to turn our lifes up side down and follow our real passions.

We are best friends and on May 2012 we decided to move forward and enroll in a small business together. Vanessa had been hosting with Airbnb for 2 years by then (renting the spare room at her place in Madrid/Milan and her apartment in Barcelona) and her experience (upgraded to Superhost in early 2011) was so positive that we decided we could also help other owners that don't live in town or don't have the time to rent their properties to travelers as you. And this is what we are doing now together. 

More about us, we love to travel: Vanessa has travelled 4 out of the 5 continents with a backpack that has been with her for 18 years now and now has enrolled in her new adventure: becoming a mum in spring 2017. Conversely, Oscar travels by bike and closer to Madrid, so as often as he can he takes his bike for a short trip in the mountains (he's really fit!). He has also spent several summers working in France. As the business grew, we took more people on board. Firstly Paula, a Venezuelan that has been living in Madrid for 11 years now, also keen on travels and on exploring new places. Paula is full of energy and we love her smiley caracter. And last but not least, Javi, whom you'll see on weekends and public holidays (and more often now that the Vanessa's baby is here!).

We are also keen in meeting new people and learning new things from them, but more importantly, we want you to feel at home at any of our apartments and that you feel that there's someone in town who cares for you:-) 

We enjoy little life pleasures like riding our bicycles or growing our small organic vegetables gardens. We like eco-friendly environments since we care a lot about our planet. 

We will help you to find you like home in this beautiful city and we look forward to having the opportunity to meet you soon!!

I usually travel at weekends or visit my parents, that´s why I decided becoming a host.

Born and raised in Madrid, have lived as well in Germany and the UK. Having had the chance of meeting people from all around the globe , you will be more than welcome in my house, no matter your age, sex, religion, sexual preferences or country of origin. 

So, do not hesitate to reach me in English, German or Spanish, I will be delighted in helping you with any information about my place or anything that could be of help for you, needless to say I will provide you with maps, guidance advices, local secrets and even some lonelyplanet bookguides I lend to my guests.

As a matter of fact, what will make your stay at me memorable, will not only be how amazing this place is, but also how I enjoy hosting you, I bet you will be back afterwards.

Still thinking about it?

We welcome you to Spain and we wish you a good stay in Madrid!

Oscar works as a photographer and Vanessa is an actress and theatre producer (during 2017 I became mum, so I won't be doing check in's for a while). However, until some years ago Oscar was an engineer and Vanessa was a M&A lawyer. And then one day we decided to turn our lifes up side down and follow our real passions.

We are best friends and on May 2012 we decided to move forward and enroll in a small business together. Vanessa had been hosting with Airbnb for 2 years by then (renting the spare room at her place in Madrid/Milan and her apartment in Barcelona) and her experience (upgraded to Superhost in early 2011) was so positive that we decided we could also help other owners that don't live in town or don't have the time to rent their properties to travelers as you. And this is what we are doing now together. 

More about us, we love to travel: Vanessa has travelled 4 out of the 5 continents with a backpack that has been with her for 18 years now and now has enrolled in her new adventure: becoming a mum in spring 2017. Conversely, Oscar travels by bike and closer to Madrid, so as often as he can he takes his bike for a short trip in the mountains (he's really fit!). He has also spent several summers working in France. As the business grew, we took more people on board. Firstly Paula, a Venezuelan that has been living in Madrid for 11 years now, also keen on travels and on exploring new places. Paula is full of energy and we love her smiley caracter. And last but not least, Javi, whom you'll see on weekends and public holidays (and more often now that the Vanessa's baby is here!).

We are also keen in meeting new people and learning new things from them, but more importantly, we want you to feel at home at any of our apartments and that you feel that there's someone in town who cares for you:-) 

We enjoy little life pleasures like riding our bicycles or growing our small organic vegetables gardens. We like eco-friendly environments since we care a lot about our planet. 

We will help you to find you like home in this beautiful city and we look forward to having the opportunity to meet you soon!!

Soy una persona curiosa y es lo que me ha llevado a vivir en distintos países, conocer culturas y viajar mucho.
Vivo en Madrid pero estoy prácticamente todo el tiempo fuera por viajes, así que he decidido compartir este increíble apartamento con todos. Pero no os preocupéis, estaréis muy bien atendidos ya que mis amigos de Minty Host me ayudan a cuidar a mis huéspedes cuando no estoy en la ciudad.
Me encanta viajar y todo tipo de viajes, de ocio y descanso, de turismo, de aventura, a grandes ciudades, pequeños pueblos o lugares salvajes, con familia, amigos o incluso solo. Disfruto mucho conociendo gente y aprendiendo de sus culturas.
He utilizado Airbnb para viajar en numerosas ocasiones y ahora me he decidido a ser anfitrión. Me gusta ofrecer un buen servicio, que la gente quede encantada de la experiencia y que disfruten en la vivienda, del barrio y de la ciudad en la que he vivido gran parte de mi vida y de la que estaré encantado de compartir sus mejores secretos.
Os invito a disfrutar de la estancia!

Hi I'm Bernabe!
I travel a lot - for work and - the best part - also for pleasure. I love meeting new people, tasting new food, experiencing new cultures. I have lived in different countries and continents so traveling is very much part of my DNA as well as my life experience. I have used Airbnb in the past and I am now happy to host fellow travelers.
I live in Madrid but I spend most of my time traveling so I have decided to share my beautiful apartment with you.
But don't worry, you will be well taken care of when I am not in town thanks to my friends at Minty Host, who are there to help my guests with anything they need. On my side, I will be more than happy to share with you the Madrid I love - its main landmarks but also its fantastic restaurants, bright squares, and bustling bars.
Enjoy your stay!

Vivimos durante varios años en la Plaza Mayor y allí estábamos felices, con un montón de planes a nuestro alrededor, con la tranquilidad de cualquier hogar de puertas para adentro y el bullicio de Madrid con sólo abrir los balcones.

Nuestra familia fue creciendo y tuvimos que cambiarnos de casa, pero como teníamos mucho cariño a nuestro apartamento, decidimos compartirlo con otros viajeros que quisieran conocer el encanto de Madrid.
 
¡Desde los balcones del apartamento se podía disfrutar de una de las plazas con más vida del mundo! Era 2013 y nacía Plaza Mayor Deluxe.

Todo al principio fue una aventura, la reforma, imaginar cómo decorábamos el apartamento, qué equipamiento dejábamos dentro, electrodomésticos, cómo contactábamos con la gente que quisiera alquilarlo…Lo que sí teníamos muy claro es que nuestro fin último es que los invitados que se alojaran en nuestro apartamento se sintieran como en casa.

Entonces llegó nuestra primera reserva... y luego otra y otra más… la gente no sólo venía una vez, sino que ¡muchos querían volver!
Fue cuando nos encontramos con un problema, ¡no teníamos días libres! (vaya problema, ¿verdad?). No en serio, nos daba mucha rabia que la gente que íbamos conociendo y que se iban convirtiendo en amigos quisieran venir a Madrid y no tuviéramos un lugar para ellos. Así que nos liamos la manta a la cabeza y empezamos a trabajar con más apartamentos. En el 2015 nacía Romantic, también en la Plaza Mayor, ideal para parejas. Este apartamento tiene ventanales dan a un patio interior con lo cual se puede disfrutar de los planes de la Plaza Mayor y la tranquilidad y el silencio de un patio privado. 

En el 2016 se nos presentó la oportunidad de gestionar dos apartamentos más y allá que nos lanzamos! Uno de ellos está también en la Plaza Mayor, es el apartamento de más capacidad (hasta 5 personas), lo llamamos Family. El otro está muy cerca de Plaza de España y desde sus ventanales se ve completamente el Palacio Real, las vistas de día y de noche cuando se ilumina el Palacio son espectaculares. Sencillamente impresionante!

El último, por el momento, es Elegance y lo inauguramos en Marzo de 2017. Es un apartamento espectacular, tiene dos habitaciones y en la habitación principal hay dos balcones desde los que se ve la Plaza Mayor, un salón gigante y un cuarto de baño enorme con ducha y bañera. ¡Todo lujo y elegancia!

Lo mejor sin duda de estos años ha sido la cantidad de gente estupenda que hemos ido conociendo, con ellos hemos ido creciendo y ahora tenemos amigos por todo el mundo! 

Os invitamos a que disfrutéis de nuestros apartamentos y esperamos que os sintáis como en vuestra casa.
