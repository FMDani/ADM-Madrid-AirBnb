The proximity of his apartment to the airport, and the air conditioning are big pluses in our book. Also, having traveled elsewhere around Spain, having an elevator is also a big plus. The rate was extremely affordable, and Arturo definitely deserves the five star rating on this site. \r\n\r\nTwo things to keep in mind when booking. First, while the Madrid metro is extremely convenient, Arturo's apartment isn't close to downtown Madrid. This may not matter to you, but as young-ish first time travelers to Madrid, we had some late nights coming back to the apartment. Despite that, I thought that being close to the airport was a nice compromise.\r\n\r\nAlso, there isn't a lock on the door.

There was a nearby gym that offered 1 week memberships, with a pool (open swim 3x a day), boxing heavy-bag, free weights & machines, cardio machines & spin.

There is a station change, but the metro is easily naviagable and the ones you will be using are accessible. Traveling with rolling luggage won't be a problem.  There are elevators and escalators. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is safe, the neighbors are all friendly. \r\n\r\nThe apartment building has a doorman, who welcomed me with the keys,  & personally escorted me to the elevator. Upon entering the view of the outdoor pool is breathtaking. It almost feels like a european Melrose Place, but without drama, lol.\r\n\r\nOpening the door to the apartment, I drew in a breath while squealing with delight.  I was struck by how spotless it is! The wooden floors are gorgeous, the light filters in. I simply picked up my luggage to bring into the room I was staying in, and for additional care, I placed it directly on the little area rug by the night stand. \r\n\r\nThe bathroom was so clean you could eat off the toilet, lol, but no, I did not actually do so. I loved the wall tiles in calming blues and the water pressure in the shower. A hand towel and bath towel were thoughtfully left for me on the bed. \r\n\r\nAgustina is a lovely woman, who not only made me feel like a treasured guest, but also spent time comforting me when I'd gotten flustered after a night of wondering lost after boarding a random bus in a freak windstorm. Her kindness was so appreciated. She was patient with my spanglish, encouraging when I'd felt deflated, and generous with her suggestions of an itinerary. \r\n\r\nI apologize for the delay in posting this review approximately a month after my return to the states, but I couldn't in good conscience neglect to share my wonderful experience. My memories of Madrid are so special to me. This was my first trip abroad as a single woman from start to finish, and I could not have asked for a better experience. Thank you so much, Agustina.

While her apartment is lovely, clean, and in a calm location near the city center, the room I reserved was not as advertised. Her listing says the guest room has AC, which for me was a necessity in the middle of a Madrid summer in a room with no breeze or fan. However, the air conditioning was not working and when I messaged her about it, she did not respond. After both myself and AirBnB contacted her several times without response, I decided to leave  her place in order to get a better night's sleep.  To summarize, lovely apartment in a great location, but misrepresentation of amenities, poor communication on the part of the host, and uncomfortable temperatures in the bedroom.

El piso esta medianamente bien ubicado es decir no esta bien pero tampoco esta mal. El piso esta bonito y la verdad la zona esta bastante bien.  El cuarto esta bien arreglado pero por favor pásenle un trapo de vez en cuando hay muchísimos polvo esta muy .OJO lean bien las reglas, si hay lavadora pero cuesta el aire acondicionado de mi cuarto no servía. Y para terminar Agustina puede ser buena onda a veces pero es una persona sumamente especial, lo cual al menos a mi no me hizo sentir como en casa nunca y siempre me sentí incomodo al coincidir platicar y hacer mis cosas en el piso. Varias veces le dije que necesitaba la lavandería y me decía que mañana o después cuando ella llegara . Y por ultimo luego se vuelve incomodo el piso puesto que hay dos cuartos y Agustina renta los dos entonces están los dos cuartos ocupados y ella en la sala común lo cual te hace sentirte muy apretado. Y ojo con llegar tarde puesto que una vez salí y dejo las llaves puestas desde adentro por lo tanto cuando yo metí mi llave no podía girar y abrir, no obstante que llame muchas veces el timbre la puerta y a Agustina nunca nadie respondió.

Clean and the host was incredibly friendly, accomodating and a pleasure to meet, rent from.   A few things to note... during my stay the room required A/C due to the heat and required that a unit be set up in balcony entrance which meant that the doors had to remain open to the street.  This meant that I couldn't shut the street noise out to sleep and also that the apartment could not be locked if I wanted A/C.  I came in around 4pm to take a nap one of the days I was there and woke up to a construction man right at my balcony doors because there is also scaffolding on the building and construction happening.   This also meant that the apartment is technically accessible from the street whenever those balcony doors are open.  If you are single female traveler like myself, or have items that need to be secured I wouldn't recommend this spot.  I'm not sure what conditions are like in the winter (heating).

We also cooked dinner one night and found that the apartment was adequately stocked for a simple dinner.\r\n\r\nThat said, there are a couple things that I think potential guests should know:\r\n\r\n1) the apartment is not lived in by a permanent resident.  Rather, it is treated as an investment and seems to be rented, along with many other similar apartments, through Airbnb.  This means that you do not have to worry about clutter of another person's belongings, but it also means that the apartment lacks certain items you would expect in someone's apartment: salt, pepper, paper towels, etc.  \r\n\r\n2) while the apartment was quite quiet on Wednesday night, it was quite loud on Thursday and Friday nights.  I currently live in the Village in New York City and am used to loud street traffic, but this was unbelievably loud and continued past 6 am.  I would stay again during the week, but given the noise, I would definitely think twice before staying over the weekend.\r\n\r\n3) because it appears that this ad represents several units in the same building, the specific layout of your unit may vary, and I would not rely on the photos to ensure the precise layout.  The apartment I stayed in had the bedroom in the back which helped with noise, but I do not know if other apartments are configured differently.

Then when we had a problem with the shower drain he sent over someone to fix it. He also stopped by in the middle of the stay to say hi and see how we were doing. I'd say the only downside is that the apartment complex was under some renovation so there was a lot of hammering going on opposite our walls starting at 8:30 am. Very hard on the jetlag!

It is a gorgeous place and recently renovated. He has very good taste. Overall we liked it very much, but were disappointed by the original cancellation because we had to give up the extra bedroom. That meant telling our friends who were going to spend a weekend with us that there was no room for them. We also missed a few of the amenities described such as a DVD player, toaster oven, coffee machine, and the American phone number. He told us that the bed was a queen, but it was definitely a full. We had a Spanish friend look at it, and also said it was smaller than a queen. The windows are well insulated but there is still some noise from the interior patios. This is apartment living so be forewarned that it is not always quiet, especially on the weekends and if you want to open the windows. The building's doorman is very friendly.

Walking distance to Plaza Espana, Calle Princesa and Gran Via, which means relatively quick access to restaurants, supermarkets, Royal Palace, ATMs, and Plaza Espana metro station. We had purchased a few bus tours on Viator, which were served by Julia Travel, and the departure point was at Plaza Espana.\r\n\r\nKitchen is cozy, everything is provided - fridge, microwave, toaster, tea kettles. Plenty of hot water and good water pressure. Couple of drawbacks that come to mind is summer heat - Madrid can be quite hot and dusty, in an apartment without air conditioner that means open door to the balcony during the night. Which leads to another drawback - there's a fairly popular restaurant two floors down below, with Spanish tradition of late night dining that means loud songs and other noise till late at night. However, overall the experience was pretty tolerable.\r\n\r\nThere's a fairly large daily market (Mercado) at Calle de Reyers a block away from the apartment, it's a windowless building that's easy to miss.

Raquel was nice enough to have a converter for some of your electronics, a coffee maker, iron, clean towels, and a washing machine (no dryer, not a thing in a Spain I guess. Air dry) the shower does get a little cold as it is in not in its own enclosed bathroom but basically part of the bedroom. Not a lot of hot water (10 minute shower at most) which is rough because the first thing I wanted after 18 hours in planes was a long, hot shower. The wifi was pretty spotty (it works best in the living room, not in the bathroom, and very slow in the bedroom). In summary I would stay here again no question.

There were numerous supermarkets in the vicinity. Yet the house was calm and quite (may be because it was not facing the street).\n\nPros:\n1. Apartment is as showcased by host.\n2.

Great hospitality by host\n\nCons (but not deal breakers):\n1. Internet speed might be bit disappointing sometimes as the router is in the other unit of the apartment (but host confirmed to address this immediately after I vacated).\n2.

Für zwei Personen bietet das Estudio ausreichend Platz und ist durch die große Fensterfront mit genügend Tageslicht versorgt. Besonders gut fanden wir, dass die Wohnung Rolladen hat, sodass einen die Straßenlaterne auf der Straße gegenüber nicht vom Schlafen abhielt. Das Bett bzw. die Schlafcouch ist sehr bequem, jedoch für meinen 1,92m großen Freund ein kleines bisschen zu kurz gewesen. Das Badezimmer lässt keine Wünsche offen und auch die Küche bietet mit ihrer Grundausstattung die perfekte Möglichkeit um die ein oder andere Mahlzeit zuzubereiten. Obwohl sich die Wohnung in einer belebten Gegend befindet, war es verhältnismäßig ruhig! Der Standort war perfekt um nahezu alles zufuß zu erkunden oder schnell zu einer U-Bahn Station zu gelangen. Ein großer Pluspunkt war für uns die Nähe (5-10 Minuten zufuß) zum Bahnhof Atocha, von dem der 24h Express-Bus zum Flughafen abfährt.\r\nAlles in allem hat uns der Aufenthalt sehr gut gefallen und wir würden das Estudio Museo Dino jederzeit wieder buchen und es weiterempfehlen. \r\n\r\nAuf diesem Weg möchten wir Mercedes und ihrem Mann noch einmal ein großes Dankeschön aussprechen!

{"review_id":904642,"score":60,"comments":"Mercedes is a lovely person and a delightful hostess, so I want to be able to give her apartment a fantastic review. The apartment is teeny tiny, newly remodeled, dark, and a good choice for someone who is not claustrophobic.  Those descriptions may sound contradictory but a careful review reader who parses each word will be fully informed and better able to determine if this is the place for him/her. The apartment is actually a single room on the interior air shaft of a beautiful old Madrid apartment that Mercedes occupies.  While visitors have a separate door and key, you do enter her apartment to get to your room.  Once you have seen Mercedes' gorgeous sun and light-filled rooms on the other side of the entry hall, your room feels even more cell-like.  One mandatory for me is wireless Internet access and that was a problem during my visit.  Mercedes was apologetic and tried to help but her network remained a problem throughout my stay.  In order to check the day's weather, without internet, you have to lean way into your air shaft window and try to see the sky---difficult.  There is also an odd smell, like sewage mixed with curry, that bubbles up from the shower drain and permeates the space.  The one window does not bring any light into the space but opening it did provide some relief from the smell, even if it also brought cold in. On the plus side, the remodel is new, the bed is comfortable, the kitchen is easy to use and stocked with Ikea basics, there is a generous wardrobe for clothes, and the towel warmer in the doll-like bathroom keeps the whole apartment warm and dries socks and delicates (and warms towels for shower--also provided).  The bery best part about the apartment is Mercedes, her kindness, and her wonderful suggestions for seeing Madrid.  ","listing_name":"Retiro Park, Stay at cosy studio","price_for_night":63.0},

With the hit and miss nature of hotel experiences threatening the enjoyment of our vacation, we decided to forgo the risk and stay with Mercedes.\r\n\r\nThe other reviews are correct: the space is cozy, so don't expect a palace (though we did note that it feels bigger than the pictures indicate). However the apartment is impeccably clean, charming, convenient to subways, and located in a safe and quiet part of the city away from the annoying tourist-y areas (for those familiar with New York City, think an Upper West Side-ish vibe). The well-equipped kitchenette was also ideal for our style of vacation -- we made light breakfast in every morning, and kept snacks for the afternoons and evenings, too.\r\n\r\nMercedes' home is in an elegant elevator building with secure access and a very up-scale feel. Returning to the apartment at the end of the day really felt like coming home rather than checking back in to a nondescript hotel room. The host herself is gracious and sweet, as well.\r\n\r\nWe would recommend Mercedes' apartment to friends, family and anyone else visiting Madrid.

{"review_id":13931256,"score":98,"comments":"Felipe was very responsive to our emails and flexible. He let us drop off our luggage early so we wouldn't have to carry it around with us. He was also understanding about the fact that there would be a third person staying with us for just part of the week; he only applied the extra person charge for those nights. His apartment is small, but in our experience that is normal for Madrid. It is clean and stocked with everything necessary--extra sheets, towels, cooking utensils, etc. The internet connection is good, which we appreciated very much. The best thing is the apartment's location--it is easy to get to the airport by Metro (which we did on the way in) or by Cercanias at Atocha (which we did on the way out). We didn't find it necessary to use the Metro while we were staying at Felipe's apartment--we like to walk and all the places we wanted or needed to go to (museums, Retiro, other major sights, buses leaving from Principe Pio) were within a 30-minute walk. But it is very close to three Metro stations if you prefer not to walk. The apartment opens onto a courtyard shared with the rest of the building. During the day you can hear other people talking or watching TV if you have the window open, but for the most part the neighbors are quiet at night and we had no trouble sleeping. In any case, the windows could be closed and the AC turned on to drown out any outside noise. The shower is small. We are thin but very tall and found it a bit cramped. I mention this not because it was a problem for us but because some larger people might find it hard to use the shower. All things considered, we can confidently recommend Felipe's apartment--he's a good host and his apartment worked very well for us. \r\nIf you stay here we highly recommend eating dinner at the nearby Gau&Cafe--it's on a rooftop just a few blocks away.

The neighborhood was relatively quiet at night, but we could hear the neighbors occasionally. Felipe was easy to communicate with, and was accommodating by allowing us to pick up the keys early. My only complaint was that the place is listed as having a washer and dryer for clothes, and only after washing our clothes the night before we left did we realize that there actually is no dryer, so that was inaccurate and a bit inconvenient.

Its also a lovely quiet apartment, a really peaceful oasis, so we were well rested each morning. At the end of each day ,the fantastic sunsets from the west facing terrace were just beautiful. The kitchen was a great place to cook and prepare,with everything easily accessible, and I always had company and chat from whoever perched on a stool. The area was so near all the main attractions, we really enjoyed walking around,but we could also use the Metro ,as there were 2 stops nearby. We were so lazy that we would walk DOWN to Lavapies, then get off at Anton Martin on the way home, so that we were STILL walking downhill!

The flat is very tastefully presented, spacious, bright and the location is very central.  However, to justify the high cost that we paid, (same as any three-star hotel in the area), there are some important improvements I recommend, (and am confident Vin would accommodate). 1. Much greater cleanliness is required, this was in our mind not acceptable and easily solved. 2. A proper 3rd bed or mattress, my friend slept horribly on the one present. 3. Communicating the heavy slog up and down the 4 floors without an elevator, my friend has back issues and caused us some grief. And 4th, I seriously think it's poor form to charge us for towels and linen and late arrival when we are already paying for one of the most expensive flats in the area. Given the high price for this accommodation we simply expected more. Would I come back? Sure, but only if these requirements were met, there are many other offers nearby and competition is fierce.

Many great restaurants nearby, as well as the most popular tapas areas in Madrid.  An indoor food market (with 20-30 individual booths) is near the subway stop. \r\nI never  met the owners (a scheduling conflict), but the lady upstairs, at the arrangement of the owners, was very kind to let us in and give us the keys. I was very pleased with the entire experience.","listing_name":"Amazing apt in the historic center","price_for_night":114.0},

We tended to stay in the immediate neighborhood which was full of cute bars and restaurants, but did venture up to Puerta Sol for chocolate and churros :) The apartment itself was spotlessly clean and very comfortable and quiet - it was definitely one of the best equipped Air BNB apartments I've stayed in with loads of extra bedding, a good hairdryer, washer & dryer, lots of maps and tour books, etc. The nicest touch was when Alicia and Carlos met us and left out a little snack selection on arrival - we were starving after a day of travel and it was such a thoughtful gesture.

{"review_id":475955,"score":42,"comments":"To be perfectly honest, our experience staying with Raul could not have been better.  Being our first Air BnB experience, we were a little nervous about staying in a stranger's home- but we could not have made a better decision.\r\n\r\nFrom first contact, Raul was warm and accommodating- even accommodating a last minute date change the week of our arrival.  Day of, we found the apartment with no problems- he had given us fabulous directions. He helped us up to his flat (we were in the process of moving to London, so we were carrying a TON of luggage), and then offered us a beer while he explained the lay of the land.  He gave us a brief orientation not only to the flat, but to Madrid itself- providing us with maps of the neighbourhood, the city and the metro system.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is a great spot- big and bright, and the bedroom is very comfortable.  He has a whole shelf of maps, travel books, etc. to make the orientation even easier.  Raul made us breakfast every morning, and we had a key to come and go as we pleased.  What made the experience so memorable for us, however, was not the apartment, but Raul himself.  I cannot imagine a more hospitable host- a genuinely kind and engaging guy- he even walked us to the metro when we left!  If you're making the trip to Madrid, I would definitely suggest staying with Raul.  You won't regret it!  Thank you, Raul!!!","listing_name":"Bedroom in Chueca Madrid","price_for_night":70.0},

We walked everywhere and only used metro to get to/from the airport. \r\n-Bedroom was comfortable and clean.

{"review_id":244694485,"score":17,"comments":"I really enjoyed my stay at Raul's. I spent two night's at his apartment. It is located in an area that has a lot to offer in terms of various cuisines and nightlife options. Raul is also a very good resource if you need help planning a night out or deciding where you should have your tapas.\n\nThe apartment is very well decorated in my opinion and is kept clean and tidy. I am asthmatic and suffer from allergies as well but had no issues during my stay. Like he mentioned, Raul owns a cat but it is a Sphynx so you don't need to worry about fur being everywhere. Tip: Sphynxes still secrete the allergenic cat protein that makes your eyes itchy or red but you will be fine once you remember to wash your hands after playing with her. I played with the cat a few times and never had any issues. Both Raul and his cat were very respectful of my space and were only around when I wanted them to be.\n\nThe room that I stayed in is very spacious and well heated. Although I did not need to use it, I noticed that there was a portable A/C unit that could be used in warmer seasons. The bathroom is also spacious, heated and comfortable to use. The kitchen is also stocked with the basics (coffee, breads, eggs, milk etc). If you have any special preferences such as needing soy/almond milk instead of regular just let Raul know and he will help you out.\n\nYou might have also noticed that Raul offers free massages. I took him up on the offer an was not let down. He was very professional, respectful and best of all experienced. He is a certified therapeutic masseuse and has a special room that is equipped with a massage bed. In my case I really needed it because my muscles were ridiculously sore after spending the entire previous night out eating,drinking and dancing in Madrid.

Talk about the situation of the House does not make sense, because looking at the map one can see who is in the heart of Madrid. With regard to the building and the House I can only say that from the first time you get into a world full of history, culture and art. And when it comes to the host, I have to say that it is one of those people that gives you everything. Connect with you immediately and in five minutes makes you feel that you are at home. He is a cultured, intelligent and with an empathy out of the ordinary person. But if you are lucky to meet Astor, then I tell you that you are not going to have time or desire to go out on the streets. That boy, he has an imagination, a smile and so rare dialectical capacity, which, when you talk to him, you get to forget about time and space. Therefore, when you return to Madrid, not I hesitate returning home Charo. I loved it and I recommend it to everyone.\r\n\r\nEstuve sólo un día en casa de Charo. Hablar de la situación de la casa no tiene sentido, pues mirando el mapa cualquiera puede ver que está en el corazón de Madrid.

Y por lo que toca a la anfitriona, tengo que decir que es una de esas personas que lo da todo. Conecta contigo enseguida y a los cinco minutos te hace sentir que estás en tu casa. Es una persona culta, inteligente y con una empatía fuera de lo normal. Pero si tenéis la suerte de conocer a Astor, entonces os digo que no vais a tener tiempo ni ganas de salir a la calle Ese chico, tiene una imaginación, una sonrisa y una capacidad dialéctica tan poco común, que, cuando hablas con él, llegas a olvidarte del tiempo y del espacio.

She has limited English, but was very patient with my even more limited Spanish! She is very knowledgeable about the city, and was able to direct me to the perfect place to purchase the authentic Spanish fan I had been seeking (Casa Diego). Her apartment is in a lively neighborhood close to museums and shopping, but the room faces onto a quiet courtyard, so no problems with noise. It was very hot in Madrid during my stay; but while there is no air-conditioning, the room stayed cool with the help of an electric fan. The room is very spacious as described and the bathroom next door was for my use alone. Ample hot water and pressure made for my first decent shower since arriving in Spain the month before. I took Charo up on her offer to drive me to the airport for 30 Euros (the fixed price in Madrid that a taxi charges for an airport ride). She got up at 6 am to drive me, and at that hour the trip took less than half an hour. I got to the airport 2 hours before my flight was scheduled to depart; but it took over an hour to check in and I made it through security just in time to board. Based on this experience, I would suggest that Charo tell furure guests to plan on arriving at least 3 hours before an international flight out of Madrid.

There my brother and I were left wondering whether we actually were in the right place, as nobody opened either of the two doors on the floor. Instead, for a good 5 minutes we had to stand there and listen to a man and a woman shouting at each other in one of the flats while their dog was barking really loudly. Finally, I called Charo again. She and her husband turned out to be the fighting couple.\r\n\r\nWe didn't get any recommendations from her, and the breakfast she provided us with were tiny buns wrapped in plastic, some stale biscuits and toast.\r\n\r\nThe doors in the flat are quite creaky, so the first time I tried to shut it, it made a bit of noise. I am a very careful person who doesn't use excessive force, so it really wasn't all that loud. Charo's husband then told me in a very aggravated manner not to slam the door, which I didn't. We apologised anyway and didn't really think about the incident anymore. But a few hours later, I got a message on AIRBNB from Charo, saying that 'they would not indulge such behaviour' and if we 'came to their house to make our stay more economical than a hotel, the least they ask is education'. We felt very attacked, especially since we'd apologised beforehand.\r\n\r\nOn quite a few photos that have now been removed, a spacious living room was to be seen. We were led to believe that this room was accessible to the guests, which it wasn't.\r\n\r\nBut we stayed at the apartment for 4 days, and for the rest of our holiday, Charo's husband was nothing but nice. We didn't get to see much of Charo herself.\r\n\r\nThe flat is easy to find, there is a supermarket in the same street, and you really can explore Madrid on foot if you stay there.\r\n\r\nOverall, our stay was very nice.\r\n","listing_name":"*** MALASAÑA B&B ***","price_for_night":45.0},

First of all, her residence was very difficult to find. Finally, after finding the building, she never even came downstairs to let us know where to go. After entering the residence, we were taken to a dirty, dusty room which was not appealing at all. Next, the man that she is residing with is absolutely crazy. He's extremely argumentative and aggressive.  We were speaking to Charro in English and he started raising his voice and telling us to speak in Spanish since we were in Spain. We went out to get a bite to eat and when we came back he came to our room yelling at us and forcing the house rules in our faces, and telling us that we slammed the door, even though we hadn't. He became very aggressive and started moving towards me and into my personal space and I held my hand out and told him to step back. I felt like I was a child being scolded by her parent, and honestly I felt like he has the capability of 'snapping' at any given moment. He then started yelling at my friend to speak Spanish even though she kept telling him that she didn't speak Spanish. He kept saying \"I know you speak Spanish, I heard you\". We were looking to find another place to stay, but it was too late and our wifi wasn't working. From then on, we decided to stay out most of the day in order to avoid him. We were so uncomfortable that it almost ruined our trip. We were paranoid to make any noise at all. Even on our last night, Charro was not helpful at all, and avoided even being around us. We didn't feel welcome from the first moment to the last.  I would not recommend this bnb to anyone. If you do choose this bnb, beware and make sure you speak Spanish and be able to recite their house rules. Susie/Helen.","listing_name":"*** MALASAÑA B&B ***","price_for_night":45.0},

She made us feel at home and she provided a good breakfast, quite a great deal better than I've experienced in other AirBnBs.

The location is also fantastic as there are great restaurants everywhere and Charo also recommended quite a few other places for us to visit.

Weird atmospher. If you want to have fun at the place you stay, put music and laugh with your friends at any time, this isn’t the right place to stay!  The two good points about the flat was the free “croissant” and coffee in the kitchen and the fact that the apartment is really well located, just in the center. When we left the apartment with a little late (20mins), the only thing Charo asked us when we called her on the phone to ask her where to put the key was: “why are you still there?” Really upset, she didn’t asked how we found the stay or anything else then hang up the phone.

There are french doors that open to a closed in space, so it gets a breeze but no street noises so my wife and I had quiet nights to sleep – and a TV to see the local news and weather. The host had coffee, espresso, juice, water, candy, and other minor amenities in the commons/kitchen that were nice to have while we were getting ready in the morning – other AirBnb did not, but no complaints. The host lived elsewhere and we shared the loft with a two students that were studying there, but never saw them.

She did our washing, helped us at the post office (greatly appreciated!), cleaned our room, made us lots of coffee and dropped us to the train station. I felt like she was our Spanish grandmother!!! The room was big and had great curtains to block the early morning sun out for a great sleep in. The beds were very comfortable. We had our own bathroom, the shower was small but did the job. The location is a bit out of the city but public transport made it easy to get anywhere (only 2 stops to Atocha station. Would definitely stay here again!!

Malinka is a walking book of knowledge and is very helpful with places of interest, where to go, what to see, etc. the 2 rooms had confortable beds. \r\nOne negative thing I want to mention has to with kids at a small age playing outside below our apartment, and sometimes yelling while our window was open. The parents are out with them till after 12 \r\no'clock. They don't really seem to care people are trying to rest or sleep.
